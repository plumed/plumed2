/*
Calclulate the DRMSD between segments of a protein and a reference structure of interest

This action is used in the shortcuts [ALPHARMSD](ALPHARMSD.md), [ANTIBETARMSD](ANTIBETARMSD.md) and [PARABETARMSD](PARABETARMSD.md).  It calculates a
vector of [DRMSD](DRMSD.md) values between a single reference multiple configurations and the instantaneous
positions of various groups of atoms.  For example, in the following input we define a single set of reference
set of coordinates for 3 atoms.

```plumed
c1: SECONDARY_STRUCTURE_DRMSD ...
    ATOMS=13-24
    BONDLENGTH=0.17 STRUCTURE1=1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
    SEGMENT1=0,1,2 SEGMENT2=3,4,5
    SEGMENT3=6,7,8 SEGMENT4=9,10,11
...
PRINT ARG=c1 FILE=colvar
```

A four dimensional vector is then returned that contains the DRMSD distances between the 4 sets of 3 atoms that were specified using the `SEGMENT` keywords
and the reference coordinates.  Notice that you can use multiple instances of the `STRUCTURE` keyword.  In general the the number of vectors output
is equal to the number of times the `STRUCTURE` keyword is used.  Further note that the indices specified to the SEGMENT keywords give the indices in the list
of atoms specified by the ATOMS keyword.  `SEGMENT1=0,1,2` in the above input is measuring the distance between the instaneous positions of atoms 13, 14 and 15
and the reference structure.

## Periodic boundary conditions

If you turn off periodic boundary conditions by using the NOPBC flag as shown below:

```plumed
c1: SECONDARY_STRUCTURE_DRMSD ...
    ATOMS=13-24 NOPBC
    BONDLENGTH=0.17 STRUCTURE1=1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1
    SEGMENT1=0,1,2 SEGMENT2=3,4,5
    SEGMENT3=6,7,8 SEGMENT4=9,10,11
...
PRINT ARG=c1 FILE=colvar
```

the distances between in the instaneous structure are evaluated in a way that does not take the periodic boundary conditions
into account.  Whenver this flag is __not__ present the distances in the instaneous structure are evaluated in a way that takes the periodic boundary conditions
into account.

If you use the `ALIGN_STRANDS` flag to evaluate the distances in a way that takes the periodic boundary conditions into accounts means that
calculating the distance between the positions of the 7th and 22nd atoms ($\mathbf{x}_7$ and $\mathbf{x}_{22}$) of the instanenous structures
using the periodic boundary conditions.  The 22 atom is the repositioned at:

$$
\mathbf{x}_{22} = \mathbf{x}_7 + ( \mathbf{x}_{22} - \mathbf{x}_7 )
$$

where the difference in the second term on the right of the equality sign is evaluated using the periodic boundary conditions. New positions are then determined
for atoms 16 through 30 by adding the difference (evaluated without PBC) between the new position for atom 22 after the above transformation has been perfomed and the
original position of this atom.  This treatment is designed for making sure that the two strands of the [ANTIBETARMSD](ANTIBETARMSD.md) and [PARABETARMSD](PARABETARMSD.md)
sheets are not broken by the periodic boundaries.

## Working with beta sheet like structures

As discussed in the documentation for [ANTIBETARMSD](ANTIBETARMSD.md) and [PARABETARMSD](PARABETARMSD.md) using the STRANDS_KEYWORD cutoff can speed up the calculation
dramatically.  The reason this keyword gives such dramatric speed ups is illustrated by the example input:

The input above illustrates the input that is used by the shortcut that computes the [ANTIBETARMSD](ANTIBETARMSD.md). You can see that the distances between the atoms on the two strands of the
beta sheet are computed in a [DISTANCE](DISTANCE.md) action before we computed the SECONDARY_STRUCTURE_DRMSD values.  These distances are then transformed by a Heavyside function that is 1 if
the distance is less than 1 nm and zero otherwise.  This vector of ones and zeros is then fed into the SECONDARY_STRUCTURE_DRMSD action as a mask.  By doing this we ensure that SECONDARY_STRUCTURE_DRMSD
values are only computed for parts of the strand that are close together. This avoids performing unecessarily expensive calculations and is also a reasonable thing to do as if the two strands are more than
1 nm appart the residues in question are not at all similar to a beta sheet structure.
