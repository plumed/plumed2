Probabilistic analysis of molecular motifs.

Probabilistic analysis of molecular motifs (PAMM) was introduced in the papers in the bibliography.
The essence of this approach involves calculating some large set of collective variables
for a set of atoms in a short trajectory and fitting this data using a Gaussian Mixture Model.
The idea is that modes in these distributions can be used to identify features such as hydrogen bonds or
secondary structure types.

The assumption within this implementation is that the fitting of the Gaussian mixture model has been
done elsewhere by a separate code.  You thus provide an input file to this action which contains the
means, covariance matrices and weights for a set of Gaussian kernels, $\{\phi\}$.  The values and
derivatives for the following set of quantities is then computed:

$$
s_k = \frac{ \phi_k}{ \sum_i \phi_i }
$$

Each of the $\phi_k$ is a Gaussian function that acts on a set in quantities calculated that might be calculated
using a [TORSION](TORSION.md), [DISTANCE](DISTANCE.md) or [ANGLE](ANGLE.md) action for example.
These quantities are then inserted into the set of $n$ kernels that are in the the input file.   This will be done for multiple sets of values
for the input quantities and a final quantity will be calculated by summing the above $s_k$ values or
some transformation of the above.  This sounds less complicated than it is and is best understood by
looking through the example given below, which can be expanded to show the full set of operations that PLUMED is performing.

\warning Mixing input variables that are periodic with variables that are not periodic has not been tested

## Examples

In this example I will explain in detail what the following input is computing:

```plumed
#SETTINGS MOLFILE=regtest/pamm/rt-pamm-periodic/M1d.pdb INPUTFILES=regtest/pamm/rt-pamm-periodic/2D-testc-0.75.pammp
MOLINFO MOLTYPE=protein STRUCTURE=regtest/pamm/rt-pamm-periodic/M1d.pdb
psi: TORSION ATOMS1=@psi-2 ATOMS2=@psi-3 ATOMS3=@psi-4
phi: TORSION ATOMS1=@phi-2 ATOMS2=@phi-3 ATOMS3=@phi-4
p: PAMM ARG=phi,psi CLUSTERS=regtest/pamm/rt-pamm-periodic/2D-testc-0.75.pammp MEAN
PRINT ARG=p-1_mean,p-2_mean FILE=colvar
```

The best place to start our explanation is to look at the contents of the `2D-testc-0.75.pammp` file, which you can do
by clicking on the links in the annotated input above.  This files contains the parameters of two two-dimensional Gaussian functions.
Each of these Gaussian kernels has a weight, $w_k$, a vector that specifies the position of its center, $\mathbf{c}_k$, and a covariance matrix, $\Sigma_k$.
The $\phi_k$ functions that we use to calculate our PAMM components are thus:

$$
\phi_k = \frac{w_k}{N_k} \exp\left( -(\mathbf{s} - \mathbf{c}_k)^T \Sigma^{-1}_k (\mathbf{s} - \mathbf{c}_k) \right)
$$

In the above $N_k$ is a normalization factor that is calculated based on $\Sigma$.  The vector $\mathbf{s}$ is a vector of quantities
that are calculated by the input [TORSION](TORSION.md) actions.  This vector must be two dimensional and in this case each component is the value of a
torsion angle.  If we look at the two TORSION actions in the above we are calculating the $\phi$ and $\psi$ backbone torsional
angles in a protein (Note the use of [MOLINFO](MOLINFO.md) to make specification of atoms straightforward).  We thus calculate the values of our
2 $ \{ \phi \} $  kernels 3 times.  The first time we use the $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles in the second residue of the protein,
the second time it is the $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles of the third residue of the protein and the third time it is the $\phi$ and $\psi$ angles
of the fourth residue in the protein.  The final two quantities that are output by the print command, p.mean-1 and p.mean-2, are the averages
over these three residues for the quantities:

$$
s_1 = \frac{ \phi_1}{ \phi_1 + \phi_2 }
$$

and

$$
s_2 = \frac{ \phi_2}{ \phi_1 + \phi_2 }
$$

There is a great deal of flexibility in this input.  We can work with, and examine, any number of components, we can use any set of collective variables
and compute these PAMM variables and we can transform the PAMM variables themselves in a large number of different ways when computing these sums.  Furthermore,
by expanding the shortcuts in the example above we can obtain insight into how the PAMM method operates.
