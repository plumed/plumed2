//+PLUMEDOC VOLUMES INSPHERE
/*
This quantity can be used to calculate functions of the distribution of collective variables for the atoms that lie in a particular, user-specified part of of the cell.

This action can be used to calculate whether each of the atoms are within a particular part of the simulation box or not as illustrated by the following example:

```plumed
f: FIXEDATOM AT=0,0,0
a: INSPHERE ATOMS=1-100 CENTER=f RADIUS={GAUSSIAN R_0=1.5}
PRINT ARG=a FILE=colvar
```

The 100 elements of the vector `a` that is returned from the INSPHERE action in the above input are calculated using:

$$
w(x_i,y_i,z_i) = \sigma\left( \sqrt{ x_i^2 + y_i^2 + z_i^2}  \right)
$$

In this expression $x_i$, $y_i$ and $z_i$ are the components of the vector that connects the $i$th atom that was specified using the `ATOMS` keyword to the atom that was specified using the `CENTER` keyword and
$\sigma$ is one of the switching functions that is described that in the documentation for the action [LESS_THAN](LESS_THAN.md).  In other words,
$w(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ is 1 if atom $i$ is within a sphere with a radial extent that is determined by the parameters of the specified switching function
and zero otherwise.

If you want to caluclate and print the number of atoms in the sphere of interest you can use an input like the one shown below:

```plumed
f: FIXEDATOM AT=0,0,0
a: INSPHERE ATOMS=1-100 CENTER=f RADIUS={GAUSSIAN R_0=1.5}
s: SUM ARG=a PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=s FILE=colvar
```

You can also calculate the average values of symmetry functions in the sphere of interest by using inputs similar to those described the documentation for the [AROUND](AROUND.md)
action. In other words, you can swap out AROUND actions for an INSPHERE actions.  Also as with [AROUND](AROUND.md), earlier versions of PLUMED used a different syntax for doing these types of calculations, which can
still be used with this new version of the command.  However, we strongly recommend using the newer syntax.
