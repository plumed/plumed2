//+PLUMEDOC MATRIX DISTANCE_MATRIX
/*
Calculate a matrix of distances between atoms.

To calculate the matrix of distances between every distinct pair of atoms in a single group you can use the following command:

```plumed
d1: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUP=1-7
```

If you would like to calculate the matrix of distances between the atoms in two different groups of atoms you can use the following command:

```plumed
d2: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUPA=1-7 GROUPB=8-20
```

Once you have calculated your distance matrix in this way you can do many of the operations that were discussed for [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md) with the output.
For example, you can use the COMPONENTS flag to calcuate the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of the vectors connecting the atoms in your two groups by using
an input like that shown below:

```plumed
d1: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 COMPONENTS
```

##Â Optimisation details

If for some reaon, you only want to calculate the distances if they are less than a certain CUTOFF you can add the cutoff keyword as follows:

```plumed
d3: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 CUTOFF=1.0
```

This command will only store those distances that are less than 1 nm.  Notice, however, that the cutoff implemented here is __not__ a continuous function.
You should thus be careful when commands such as this one above to ensure that any quantities that are forced have continuous derivatives.  If you use
the CUTOFF keyword, however, many of the features that are used to optimise [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md) are used for this action.
