Adjacency matrix in which two atoms are adjacent if they are within a certain cutoff.

As discussed [here](module_adjmat.md) a useful tool for developing complex collective variables is the notion of the
so called adjacency matrix.  An adjacency matrix is an $N \times N$ matrix in which the $i$th, $j$th element tells you whether
or not the $i$th and $j$th atoms/molecules from a set of $N$ atoms/molecules are adjacent or not.  These matrices can then be further
analyzed using a number of other algorithms as is detailed in \cite tribello-clustering.

For this action the elements of the contact matrix are calculated using:

$$
 a_{ij} = \sigma( |\mathbf{r}_{ij}| )
$$

where $|\mathbf{r}_{ij}|$ is the magnitude of the vector connecting atoms $i$ and $j$ and where $\sigma$ is a switching function.

## Examples

The input shown below calculates a $6 \times 6$ matrix whose elements are equal to one if atom $i$ and atom $j$ are within 0.3 nm
of each other and which is zero otherwise.  The columns in this matrix are then summed so as to give the coordination number for each atom.
The final quantity output in the colvar file is thus the average coordination number.

```plumed
mat: CONTACT_MATRIX ATOMS=1-6 SWITCH={EXP D_0=0.2 R_0=0.1 D_MAX=0.66}
ones: ONES SIZE=6

Adjacency matrix in which two atoms are adjacent if they are within a certain cutoff.

A useful tool for developing complex collective variables is the notion of the
so called adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix can be an $N \times N$ matrix in which the $i$th, $j$th element tells you whether
or not the $i$th and $j$th atoms/molecules from a set of $N$ atoms/molecules are adjacent or not. Alternatively, you can calculate
an adjacency matrix between a set of $N$ atoms and a second set of $M$ atoms.  For this type of matrix the $i$th, $j$th element tells you
whether the whether the $i$th atom in the first group and the $j$th atom in the second group are adjacent or not.  The adjacency matrix in this
case is thus $N \times M$.

The simplest type of adjacency matrix is a contact matrix.  The elements of a contact matrix are calculated using:

$$
a_{ij} = \sigma( r_{ij} )
$$

where $r_{ij}$ is the magnitude of the vector connecting atoms $i$ and $j$ and where $\sigma$ is a switching function. If you want to calculate a
contact matrix for one group of atoms the input would look something like this:

```plumed
c1: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
```

Alternatively, if you want to calculate the contact matrix between two groups of atoms you would use an input like following:

```plumed
c2: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUPA=1-7 GROUPB=8-20 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
```

Once you have calculated a contact matrix you can perform various matrix operations by using the tools in the matrixtools or clusters modules.

## Coordination numbers

If a contact matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, is multiplied from the back by a vector of ones the $i$th element of the resulting matrix tells you the number of atoms that are
within $r_c$ of atom $i$.  In other words, the coordination numbers of the atoms can be calculated from the contact matrix by doing matrix vector multiplication.

This realisation about the relationship between the contact map and the coordination number is heavily used in PLUMED.  For example, to calculate
and print the coordination numbers of the first 7 atoms in the system with themselves you would use an input something like this:

```plumed
c1: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 D_0=0.0 R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12
ones: ONES SIZE=7
cc: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=c1,ones
PRINT ARG=cc FILE=colvar
```

This input transforms the distances using the RATIONAL switching function that is discussed in the documentation for [LESS_THAN](LESS_THAN.md)
The parameters for this type of switching function can be specified using `D_0`, `R_0`, `NN` and `MM` keywords as indicated above. However, we would recommend
using the following syntax instead as this allows you to use the full range of switching function types. Most importantly, if you use the following syntax you can
set the D_MAX parameter, as shown below. As discussed in the optimization details section below, __if you want good computational performance on large systems it is essential to set the D_MAX parameter.__


```plumed
c1: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12 D_MAX=5.0}
ones: ONES SIZE=7
cc: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=c1,ones
PRINT ARG=cc FILE=colvar
```

Implmenting the coordination number as a product of a matrix and a vector is useful as there are many different ways to define whether two atoms/molecules and to construct a "contact" matrix based on
the result.  For example:

* You could say that two molecules are connected if they are within a certain distance of each other and if they have the same orientation (see [TORSIONS_MATRIX](TORSIONS_MATRIX.md)).
* You could say that two water molecules are connected if they are hydrogen bonded to each other (see [HBOND_MATRIX](HBOND_MATRIX.md)).
* You could say that two atoms are connected if they are within a certain distance of each other and if they have similar values for a CV (see [OUTER_PRODUCT](OUTER_PRODUCT.md)).

When the coordination numbers is implemented in the way described above (by doing the matrix-vector multiplication) you have the flexibility to define the contact matrix that
is used in the multiplication in whatever way you choose.  In other words, this implementation of the coordination number is much more flexible. For example, suppose you want
to calculate the number of atoms that have a coordination is greater than 3.0.  You can do this with PLUMED using the following input:

```plumed
# Calculate the contact matrix for the first seven atoms in the system
c1: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
# Calculate the coordination numbers for the first seven atoms in the system
ones: ONES SIZE=7
cc: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=c1,ones
# Set the ith element of the vector mtc equal to one if the coordination number of atom i is greater than 3.
mtc: MORE_THAN ARG=cc SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=3 R_0=1}
# Calculate the number of atoms with a coordination number greater than 3.
s: SUM ARG=mtc PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=s FILE=colvar
```

Alternatively, consider the CV that was used to study perovskite nucleation in [this paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b04259).  The CV here measures the number of
methylamonium molecules that are attached to at least 5 other methylamoniusm molecules, at least 7 lead atoms and at least 11 ionide ions.  We can calculate something akin to this
CV and apply a restraint on the resulting quantity by using the following input file:

```plumed
# Lead ions
Pb: GROUP ATOMS=1-64
# Iodide atoms
I: GROUP ATOMS=65-256
# Methylamonium "atoms" -- in the real CV these are centers of mass rather than single atoms
cn: GROUP ATOMS=257-320

ones64: ONES SIZE=64
# Contact matrix that determines if methylamonium molecules are within 8 A of each other
cm_cncn: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=cn SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.8}
# Coordination number of methylamounium with methylamonium
cc_cncn: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cm_cncn,ones64
# Vector with elements that are one if coordiantion of methylamonium with methylamonium >5
mt_cncn: MORE_THAN ARG=cc_cncn SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=5 NN=12 MM=24}

# Contact matrix that determines if methylamoinium moleulcule and Pb atom are within 7.5 A of each other
cm_cnpb: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUPA=cn GROUPB=Pb SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.75}
# Coordination number of methylamonium with Pb
cc_cnpb: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cm_cnpb,ones64
# Vector with elements that are one if coordination of methylamounium with lead is >7
mt_cnpb: MORE_THAN ARG=cc_cnpb SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=7 NN=12 MM=24}

ones192: ONES SIZE=192
# Contact matrix that determines if methylamoinium moleulcule and I atom are within 6.5 A of each other
cm_cnI: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUPA=cn GROUPB=I SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.65}
# Coordination number of methylamonium with I
cc_cnI: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cm_cnI,ones192
# Vector with elements that are one if coordination of methylamounium with lead is >11
mt_cnI: MORE_THAN ARG=cc_cnI SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=11 NN=12 MM=24}

# Element wise product of these three input vectors.
# mm[i]==1 if coordination number of corrsponding methylamounium with methylamonium is >5
# and if coordination of methylamounium with Pb is >7 and if coordination of methylamounium with I > 11
mm: CUSTOM ARG=mt_cncn,mt_cnpb,mt_cnI FUNC=x*y*z PERIODIC=NO

# Sum of coordination numbers and thus equal to number of methylamoniums with desired coordination numbers
ff: SUM ARG=mm PERIODIC=NO

rr: RESTRAINT ARG=ff AT=62 KAPPA=10
```

## COMPONENTS flag

If you add the flag COMPONENTS to the input as shown below:

```plumed
c4: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 COMPONENTS SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
```

then four matrices with the labels `c4.w`, `c4.x`, `c4.y` and `c4.z` are output by the action. The matrix with the label `c4.w` is the adjacency matrix
that would be output if you had not added the COMPONENTS flag. The $i,j$ component of the matrices `c4.x`, `c4.y` and `c4.z` contain the $x$, $y$ and $z$
components of the vector connecting atoms $i$ and $j$. Importantly, however, the components of these vectors are only stored in `c4.x`, `c4.y` and `c4.z`
if the elements of `c4.w` are non-zero.

## NOPBC flag

By default PLUMED calculates the distances that are transformed by the switching function in the CONTACT_MATRIX action in a way that accounts for the periodic boundary
conditions.  If for any reason you do not want PLUMED to account for the periodic boundary conditions you can use the NOPBC flag as shown below:

```plumed
c: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-7 NOPBC SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=2.6 NN=6 MM=12}
```

If you also add the COMPONENTS flag in this input then the vector connecting each pairs of atoms will also be calculated without taking the periodic boundary conditions into account.

## Optimisation details

Adjacency matrices are sparse.  Each atom is only be connected to a small number of neighbours and the vast majority of the elements of the contact matrix are thus zero.  To reduce
the amount of memory that PLUMED requires PLUMED uses sparse matrix storage.  Consequently, whenever you calculate and store a contact matrix only the elements of the matrix that are
non-zero are stored.  The same thing holds for the additional values that are created when you use the COMPONENTS flag. The components of the vectors connecting atoms are only stored
when the elements of `c4.w` are non-zero.

We can also use the sparsity of the adjacency matrix to make the time required to compute a contact matrix scale linearly rather than quadratically with the number of atoms. Element
$i,j$ of the contact matrix is only non-zero if two atoms are within a cutoff, $r_c$. We can determine that many pairs of atoms are further appart than $r_c$ without computing the
distance between these atoms by using divide and conquer strategies such as linked lists and neighbour lists.  __To turn on these features you need to set the `D_MAX` parameter in the
switching functions.__ The value you pass to the `D_MAX` keyword is used as the cutoff in the link cell algorithm.

In theory we could further optimize the implementation of the CONTACT_MATRIX action by exploiting neighbor lists. If we were to do this we would likely add two further keywords as shown
below:

```plumed
c4: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-10000 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.1 NN=6 MM=12 D_MAX=0.5} NL_CUTOFF=0.7 NL_STRIDE=5
```

The `NL_CUTOFF` keyword would be used to specify the cutoff (in nm) to use when constructing neighbor lists.  This value would need to be slightly larger than the D_MAX parameter for the switching function.
The `NL_STRIDE` keyword would then be used to specify how frequently the neighbour list should be updated.  Thus far we have not found it necessary to implement this algorithm. We have been happy with the
performance even if we use the linked list algorithm to update the neighbors on every step. If you feel that you need this CV to perform better please get in touch as adding a neighbor list for this action
should be relatively straightforward.

## The MASK keyword

Suppose that you want to calculate the average coordination number for the atoms that are within a sphere in the center of your simulation box. You can do so by exploiting an input similar to the one shown
below:

```plumed
# The atoms that are of interest
ow: GROUP ATOMS=1-16500
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=ow CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Calculates cooordination numbers
cmap: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=ow SWITCH={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.32 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.34}
ones: ONES SIZE=16500
cc: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cmap,ones
# Multiply coordination numbers by sphere vector
prod: CUSTOM ARG=cc,sphere FUNC=x*y PERIODIC=NO
# Sum of coordination numbers for atoms that are in the sphere of interest
numer: SUM ARG=prod PERIODIC=NO
# Number of atoms that are in sphere of interest
denom: SUM ARG=sphere PERIODIC=NO
# Average coordination number for atoms in sphere of interest
av: CUSTOM ARG=prod,sphere FUNC=x/y PERIODIC=NO
# And print out final CV to a file
PRINT ARG=av FILE=colvar STRIDE=1
```

This calculation is slow because you have to calculate the coordination numbers of all the atoms even though only a small subset of these quanitties are required to compute the average coordination number in the
sphere.  To avoid all these unecessary calculations you use the `MASK` keyword as shown below:

```plumed
# The atoms that are of interest
ow: GROUP ATOMS=1-16500
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=ow CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Calculates cooordination numbers
cmap: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=ow SWITCH={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.32 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.34} MASK=sphere
ones: ONES SIZE=16500
cc: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cmap,ones
# Multiply coordination numbers by sphere vector
prod: CUSTOM ARG=cc,sphere FUNC=x*y PERIODIC=NO
# Sum of coordination numbers for atoms that are in the sphere of interest
numer: SUM ARG=prod PERIODIC=NO
# Number of atoms that are in sphere of interest
denom: SUM ARG=sphere PERIODIC=NO
# Average coordination number for atoms in sphere of interest
av: CUSTOM ARG=prod,sphere FUNC=x/y PERIODIC=NO
# And print out final CV to a file
PRINT ARG=av FILE=colvar STRIDE=1
```

Adding the instruction `MASK=sphere` to the CONTACT_MATRIX line in this input tells PLUMED to only calculate the $i$th row in the adjacency matrix if the $i$th element of the vector `sphere` is non-zero.
In other words, by adding this command we have ensured that we are not calculating coordination numbers for atoms that are not in the sphere that is of interest.  In this way we can thus reduce the computational
expense of the calculation enormously.

Notice, that there are other places where we can use this same trick.  For example, we could have used MASK as shown below for our calculation of the CV for perovskite nucleation as shown below:

```plumed
# Lead ions
Pb: GROUP ATOMS=1-64
# Iodide atoms
I: GROUP ATOMS=65-256
# Methylamonium "atoms" -- in the real CV these are centers of mass rather than single atoms
cn: GROUP ATOMS=257-320

ones192: ONES SIZE=192
# Contact matrix that determines if methylamoinium moleulcule and I atom are within 6.5 A of each other
cm_cnI: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUPA=cn GROUPB=I SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.65 D_MAX=1.0}
# Coordination number of methylamonium with I
cc_cnI: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cm_cnI,ones192
# Vector with elements that are one if coordination of methylamounium with lead is >11
mt_cnI: MORE_THAN ARG=cc_cnI SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=11 NN=12 MM=24}

ones64: ONES SIZE=64
# Contact matrix that determines if methylamoinium moleulcule and Pb atom are within 7.5 A of each other
cm_cnpb: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUPA=cn GROUPB=Pb SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.75 D_MAX=1.5} MASK=mt_cnI
# Coordination number of methylamonium with Pb
cc_cnpb: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cm_cnpb,ones64
# Vector with elements that are one if coordination of methylamounium with lead is >7
mt_cnpb: MORE_THAN ARG=cc_cnpb SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=7 NN=12 MM=24}

# Contact matrix that determines if methylamonium molecules are within 8 A of each other
cm_cncn: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=cn SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.8 D_MAX=1.75} MASK=mt_cnI
# Coordination number of methylamounium with methylamonium
cc_cncn: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cm_cncn,ones64
# Vector with elements that are one if coordiantion of methylamonium with methylamonium >5
mt_cncn: MORE_THAN ARG=cc_cncn SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=5 NN=12 MM=24}

# Element wise product of these three input vectors.
# mm[i]==1 if coordination number of corrsponding methylamounium with methylamonium is >5
# and if coordination of methylamounium with Pb is >7 and if coordination of methylamounium with I > 11
mm: CUSTOM ARG=mt_cncn,mt_cnpb,mt_cnI FUNC=x*y*z PERIODIC=NO

# Sum of coordination numbers and thus equal to number of methylamoniums with desired coordination numbers
ff: SUM ARG=mm PERIODIC=NO

rr: RESTRAINT ARG=ff AT=62 KAPPA=10
```

This trick works here because when we find that there are methylamoinium moleulcules with fewer than 11 lead atoms in there first coordination sphere we know that there
is no point calculating the second two coordination numbers.
