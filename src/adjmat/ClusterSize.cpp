Gives the number of atoms in the connected component

As discussed in the section of the manual on \ref contactmatrix a useful tool for developing complex collective variables is the notion of the
so called adjacency matrix.  An adjacency matrix is an \f$N \times N\f$ matrix in which the \f$i\f$th, \f$j\f$th element tells you whether
or not the \f$i\f$th and \f$j\f$th atoms/molecules from a set of \f$N\f$ atoms/molecules are adjacent or not.  When analyzing these matrix
we can treat them as a graph and find connected components using some clustering algorithm.  This action is used in tandem with this form of analysis
to output the number of atoms that are connected together in a particular connected component.  It is important to note that the quantity that is
output by this action cannot be differentiated.  As such it cannot be used as a collective variable in a biased simulation.

\par Examples

The following input uses PLUMED to calculate a adjacency matrix that connects a pair of atoms if they both have a coordination number that is greater
than 2.0 and if they are within 6.0 nm of each other.  Depth first search clustering is used to find the connected components in this matrix and then
the number of atoms in the largest cluster is found.  This quantity is then output to a file called colvar
