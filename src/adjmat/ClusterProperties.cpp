/*
Calculate properties of the distribution of some quantities that are part of a connected component

This collective variable was developed for looking at nucleation phenomena, where you are
interested in using studying the behavior of atoms in small aggregates or nuclei.  In these sorts of
problems you might be interested in the degree the atoms in a nucleus have adopted their crystalline
structure or (in the case of heterogeneous nucleation of a solute from a solvent) you might be
interested in how many atoms are present in the largest cluster \cite tribello-clustering.

\par Examples

The input below calculates the coordination numbers of atoms 1-100 and then computes the an adjacency
matrix whose elements measures whether atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$ are within 0.55 nm of each other.  The action
labelled dfs then treats the elements of this matrix as zero or ones and thus thinks of the matrix as defining
a graph.  This dfs action then finds the largest connected component in this graph.  The sum of the coordination
numbers for the atoms in this largest connected component are then computed and this quantity is output to a colvar
file.  The way this input can be used is described in detail in \cite tribello-clustering.
