Calculate the determinant of a matrix

This shorctu allows you to calculate the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of
a square matrix. The following example shows how the action is used:

```plumed
d1: DISTANCE_MATRIX ATOMS=1-5
det: DETERMINANT ARG=d1
PRINT ARG=det FILE=colvar
```

If you look at the expanded version of the input above you can see that PLUMED calculates the determinant
by first diagonalising the input matrix and then calculating the product of the eigenvalues.
