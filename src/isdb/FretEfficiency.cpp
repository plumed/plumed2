//+PLUMEDOC ISDB_COLVAR FRET
/*
Calculates the FRET efficiency between a pair of atoms.
The efficiency is calculated using the Forster relation:

\f[
E=\frac{1}{1+(R/R_0)^6}
\f]

where \f$R\f$ is the distance and \f$R_0\f$ is the Forster radius.

By default the distance is computed taking into account periodic
boundary conditions. This behavior can be changed with the NOPBC flag.


\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to print the FRET efficiencies
calculated as a function of the distance between atoms 3 and 5 and
the distance between atoms 2 and 4.
\plumedfile
fe1:  FRET ATOMS=3,5 R0=5.5
fe2:  FRET ATOMS=2,4 R0=5.5
PRINT ARG=fe1,fe2
\endplumedfile

The following input computes the FRET efficiency calculated on the
terminal atoms of a polymer
of 100 atoms and keeps it at a value around 0.5.
\plumedfile
WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=1-100
fe: FRET ATOMS=1,100 R0=5.5 NOPBC
RESTRAINT ARG=fe KAPPA=100 AT=0.5
\endplumedfile

Notice that NOPBC is used
to be sure that if the distance is larger than half the simulation
box the distance is compute properly. Also notice that, since many MD
codes break molecules across cell boundary, it might be necessary to
use the \ref WHOLEMOLECULES keyword (also notice that it should be
_before_ FRET).
Just be sure that the ordered list provide to WHOLEMOLECULES has the following
properties:
- Consecutive atoms should be closer than half-cell throughout the entire simulation.
- Atoms required later for the distance (e.g. 1 and 100) should be included in the list
