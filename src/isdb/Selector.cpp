//+PLUMEDOC ISDB_GENERIC SELECTOR
/*
Defines a variable (of the type double) inside the PLUMED code that can be used and modified by other actions.

A \ref SELECTOR can be used for example to activate or modify a bias based on its current value.

\par Examples

A typical example is the simulated-tempering like approach activated by \ref RESCALE.
In this example the total potential energy of the system is scaled
by a parameter defined on a grid of dimension NBIN in the range from 1 to MAX_RESCALE.
The value of the scaling parameter is determined by the current value of the \ref SELECTOR GAMMA.
The value of the \ref SELECTOR is updated by a MC protocol inside the \ref RESCALE class.
A well-tempered metadynamics potential is used to enhance sampling in the \ref SELECTOR space.
