/**
\page ReferencePlumedH Reference for interfacing MD codes with PLUMED

  Plumed.h and Plumed.c contain the external plumed interface, which is used to
  integrate it with MD engines. This interface is very general, and is expected
  not to change across plumed versions. Plumed.c also implements a dummy version
  of the interface, so as to allow a code to be fully linked even if the plumed
  library is not available yet. These files could be directly included in the official
  host MD distribution. In this manner, it will be sufficient to link the plumed
  library at link time (on all systems) or directly at runtime (on systems where
  dynamic loading is enabled) to include plumed features.

  Notice that in PLUMED 2.5 this interface has been rewritten in order to allow
  more debugging features and a better behavior in multithread environments.
  The interface is almost perfectly backward compatible, although it implements
  a few additional functions. See more details below.

  Why is Plumed.c written in C and not C++? The reason is that the resulting Plumed.o
  needs to be linked with the host MD code immediately (whereas the rest of plumed
  could be linked a posteriori). Imagine the MD code is written in FORTRAN: when we
  link the Plumed.o file we would like not to need any C++ library linked. In this
  manner, we do not need to know which C++ compiler will be used to compile plumed.
  The C++ library is only linked to the "rest" of plumed, which actually uses it.
  Anyway, Plumed.c is written in such a manner to allow its compilation also in C++
  (C++ is a bit stricter than C). This will
  allow e.g. MD codes written in C++ to just incorporate Plumed.c (maybe renamed into
  Plumed.cpp), without the need of configuring a plain C compiler.

  Plumed interface can be used from C, C++ and FORTRAN. Everything concerning plumed
  is hidden inside a single object type, which is described in C by a structure
  (struct \ref plumed), in C++ by a class (PLMD::Plumed) and in FORTRAN by a
  fixed-length string (CHARACTER(LEN=32)). Obviously C++ can use both struct
  and class interfaces, but the second should be preferred since it will automatically take
  care of objects constructions and destructions. The reference interface
  is the C one, whereas FORTRAN and C++ interfaces are implemented as wrappers
  around it.
  In the C++ interface, all the routines are implemented as methods of PLMD::Plumed.
  In the C and FORTRAN interfaces, all the routines are named plumed_*, to
  avoid potential name clashes. Notice that the entire plumed library
  is implemented in C++, and it is hidden inside the PLMD namespace.

  Handlers to the plumed object can be converted among different representations,
  to allow inter-operability among languages. In C, there are tools to convert
  to/from FORTRAN, whereas in C++ there are tools to convert to/from FORTRAN and C.

  These handlers only contain a pointer to the real structure, so that
  when a plumed object is brought from one language to another,
  it brings a reference to the same environment.

  Moreover, to simplify life in all cases where a single Plumed object is
  required for the entire simulation (which covers many of the practical
  applications with conventional MD codes) it is possible to take advantage
  of a global interface, which is implicitly referring to a unique global instance.
  The global object should still be initialized and finalized properly.
  This global object is obviously not usable in a multithread context.

  As of PLUMED 2.5, the interface contains a reference counter that allows
  for a better control of plumed initializations and deallocations.
  This is particularly useful for the C++ interface that now
  behaves similarly to a primitive shared pointer and can be thus copied.
  In other languages, to use the reference counter correctly it is sufficient to
  remember the following rule: for any `plumed_create*` call, there should be a corresponding
  `plumed_finalize` call. More examples can be found below.

  The basic method to send a message to plumed is
\verbatim
  (C) plumed_cmd
  (C++) PLMD::Plumed::cmd
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_CMD
\endverbatim

  To initialize a plumed object, use:
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_create
  (C++)      (constructor of PLMD::Plumed)
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_CREATE
\endverbatim

  As of PLUMED 2.5, you can also initialize a plumed object using the following functions,
  that load a specific kernel:
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_create_dlopen
  (C++)      PLMD::Plumed::dlopen
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_CREATE_DLOPEN
\endverbatim

  To finalize a plumed object, use
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_finalize
  (C++)      (destructor of PLMD::Plumed)
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_FINALIZE
\endverbatim

  To access to the global-object, use
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_gcreate, plumed_gfinalize, plumed_gcmd
  (C++)      PLMD::Plumed::gcreate, PLMD::Plumed::gfinalize, PLMD::Plumed::gcmd
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_GCREATE, PLUMED_F_GFINALIZE, PLUMED_F_GCMD
\endverbatim

  To check if the global object has been initialized, use
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_ginitialized
  (C++)      PLMD::Plumed::ginitialized
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_GINITIALIZED
\endverbatim

  Notice that when using runtime binding the plumed library might be not available.
  In this case, plumed_create (and plumed_gcreate) will still succeed, but a subsequent
  call to plumed_cmd (or plumed_gcmd) would exit. In order to avoid this
  unpleasant situation you have two options.

  First, you can check if plumed library is available before actually creating an object
  using this function:
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_installed
  (C++)      PLMD::Plumed::installed
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_INSTALLED
\endverbatim

  Alternatively, as of PLUMED 2.5, you can interrogate the just created plumed
  object using the following function:
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_valid
  (C++)      PLMD::Plumed::valid
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_VALID
\endverbatim

  If you want to create on purpose an invalid Plumed object (useful in C++ to postpone
  the loading of the library) you can use `Plumed p(Plumed::makeInvalid());`.

  To know if the global object is valid instead you should use the following function:
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_gvalid
  (C++)      PLMD::Plumed::gvalid
  (FORTRAN)  PLUMED_F_GVALID
\endverbatim

  To convert handlers between different languages, use
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_c2f                 (C to FORTRAN)
  (C)        plumed_f2c                 (FORTRAN to C)
  (C++)      Plumed(plumed) constructor (C to C++)
  (C++)      operator plumed() cast     (C++ to C)
  (C++)      Plumed(char*)  constructor (FORTRAN to C++)
  (C++)      toFortran(char*)           (C++ to FORTRAN)
\endverbatim

  As of PLUMED 2.5, when using C or C++ we allow a user to explicitly store a plumed object as
  a void pointer (indeed: that's the only thing contained in a plumed object).
  This might be useful in case you do not want to include the Plumed.h header in some
  of your headers. In order to convert to/from void pointers you can use the following functions
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_v2c                 (void* to C)
  (C)        plumed_c2v                 (C to void*)
  (C++)      Plumed(void*) constructor  (void* to C++)
  (C++)      toVoid()                   (C++ to void*)
\endverbatim
  Using the functions above is much safer than accessing directly the pointer contained in the \ref plumed struct
  since, when compiling with debug options, it will check if the void pointer actually points to a plumed object.

  As of PLUMED 2.5, we added a reference count. It is in practice possible
  to create multiple `plumed` object that refer to the same environment.
  This is done using the following functions
\verbatim
  (C)        plumed_create_reference     (from a C object)
  (C)        plumed_create_reference_f   (from a FORTRAN object)
  (C)        plumed_create_reference_v   (from a void pointer)
  (FORTRAN)  plumed_f_create_reference   (from a FORTRAN object)
\endverbatim
  In C++ references are managed automatically by constructors and destructor.
  In addition, you can manually manage them (with care!) using incref() and decref().

  The interface of the FORTRAN functions is very similar to that of the C functions
  and is listed below:

\verbatim
  FORTRAN interface
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_CREATE(p)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(OUT)   :: p
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_CREATE_DLOPEN(p,path)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(OUT)   :: p
      CHARACTER(LEN=*),  INTENT(IN)    :: path
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_CREATE_REFERENCE(p,r)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(OUT)   :: p
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(IN)    :: r
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_CREATE_INVALID(p)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(OUT)   :: p
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_CMD(p,key,val)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(IN)    :: p
      CHARACTER(LEN=*),  INTENT(IN)    :: key
      UNSPECIFIED_TYPE,  INTENT(INOUT) :: val(*)
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_FINALIZE(p)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(IN)    :: p
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_INSTALLED(i)
      INTEGER,           INTENT(OUT)   :: i
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_VALID(p,i)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(IN)    :: p
      INTEGER,           INTENT(OUT)   :: i
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_USE_COUNT(p,i)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(IN)    :: p
      INTEGER,           INTENT(OUT)   :: i
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_GLOBAL(p)
      CHARACTER(LEN=32), INTENT(OUT)   :: p
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_GINITIALIZED(i)
      INTEGER,           INTENT(OUT)   :: i
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_GCREATE()
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_GCMD(key,val)
      CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)     :: key
      UNSPECIFIED_TYPE, INTENT(INOUT)  :: val(*)
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_GFINALIZE()
    SUBROUTINE PLUMED_F_GVALID(i)
      INTEGER,           INTENT(OUT)   :: i
\endverbatim

  Almost all C functions have a corresponding FORTRAN function.
  As a simple mnemonic, if you know the name of the C function you can obtain the
  corresponding FORTRAN subroutine by adding `F_` after the `PLUMED_` prefix.
  In addition, all `plumed` objects are replaced by `CHARACTER(LEN=32)` objects
  holding the same information. These pointers basically contain a text representation
  of the stored pointer, that is suitable to be contained in a string.
  Finally, whenever a C function returns a value,
  the corresponding FORTRAN subroutine will have an additional `INTENT(OUT)` parameter
  passed as the its last argument.

  When you compile the FORTRAN interface, wrapper functions are added with several possible
  name manglings, so you should not experience problems linking the plumed library with a FORTRAN file.

\section ReferencePlumedH-exceptions Error handling

  In case an error is detected by PLUMED, either because of some user error, some internal bug,
  or some mistake in using the library, an exception will be thrown. The behavior is different depending if you use
  PLUMED from C/FORTRAN or from C++.

  First of all, notice that access to PLUMED goes through three functions:
  - plumed_create: this, as of PLUMED 2.5, is guaranteed not to throw any exception. If there is a problem, it will
    just return a NULL pointer
  - plumed_cmd: this function might throw exceptions.
  - plumed_finalize: this is a destructor and is guaranteed not to throw any exception.

  The following discussion concerns all the exceptions thrown by plumed_cmd.

  If you use C/FORTRAN, you will basically have no way to intercept the exception and the program will just terminate.

  If you use C++ but you are calling the C interface (e.g. \ref plumed_cmd), then you might be
  able to catch the exceptions thrown by PLUMED. Notice that all the exceptions thrown by PLUMED inherit from std::exception,
  so you might want to catch it by reference. Notice however that there is a C layer between your C++ code and the PLUMED
  library. In principle, the stack unwinding performed during exception handling is undefined in C and might lead to problems
  that are system and compiler dependent. In addition to this, there might be troubles when combining different compilers
  or different standard libraries. E.g., if you MD code is linked against a given C++ library and PLUMED is linked against
  another one, the two std::exception types will differ and you won't be able to catch exceptions raised by PLUMED.

  If you use C++ and you are calling the C++ interface (e.g. \ref Plumed::cmd), as of PLUMED 2.5 we implemented a complete
  remapping of the exceptions thrown by PLUMED.  This solves both the problems mentioned above. In particular:
  - Instead of throwing an exception, PLUMED will return (using a \ref plumed_nothrow_handler) the details about the occurred error.
  - An equivalent exception will be thrown within the inline PLUMED interface compiled with your MD code.

  As a consequence, you will be able to combine different compilers and avoid stack unwinding in the C layer.

  Notice that, even if you use \ref Plumed::cmd, if you are loading a kernel <=2.4 any exception generated by PLUMED will
  leak through the C layer. This might lead to undefined behavior. If you are lucky (with some compiler it works!) and
  the exception arrives to C, PLUMED will catch it and rethrow it as it would do if you were using a kernel >=2.5.

  The remapping of exceptions takes care of all the standard C++ exceptions plus all the exceptions raised within
  PLUMED. Unexpected exceptions that are derived from std::exception will be rethrown as std::exception.
  Notice that this implies some loss of information, since the original exception might have been of a different type.
  However, it also implies that the virtual table of the original exception won't be needed anymore. This allows to
  completely decouple the MD code from the PLUMED library.

\section ReferencePlumedH-2-5 New in PLUMED 2.5

  The wrappers in PLUMED 2.5 have been completely rewritten with several improvements.
  The interface is almost perfectly backward compatible, although the behavior of C++ constructors
  has been modified slightly.
  In addition, a few new functions are introduced (explicitly marked in the documentation).
  As a consequence, if your code uses some of the new functions, you will not be able
  to link it directly with an older PLUMED library (though you will still be able to load
  an older PLUMED library at runtime). In addition, the reference counter changes slightly
  the behavior of the C++ methods used to interoperate with C and FORTRAN.

  An important novelty is in the way the runtime loader is implemented.
  In particular, the loader works also if the symbols of the main executable are not exported.
  The proper functions from the kernel are indeed searched explicitly now using `dlsym`.

  Some additional features can be enabled using suitable environment variables. In particular:
  - `PLUMED_LOAD_DEBUG` can be set to report more information about the loading process.
  - `PLUMED_LOAD_NAMESPACE` can be set to `LOCAL` to load the PLUMED kernel in a separate
    namespace. The default is global namespace, which is the same behavior of PLUMED <=2.4,
    and is consistent with what happens when linking PLUMED as a shared library.
  - `PLUMED_LOAD_NODEEPBIND` can be set to load the PLUMED kernel in not-deepbind mode. Deepbind
    mode implies that the symbols defined in the library are preferred to other symbols with the same name.
    Only works on systems supporting `RTLD_DEEPBIND` and is mostly for debugging purposes.

  Another difference is that the implementation of the wrappers is now completely contained in the `Plumed.h`
  file. You can see that the `Plumed.c` is much simpler now and just includes `Plumed.h`. With a similar
  procedure you could compile the wrappers directly into your code making it unnecessary to link
  the libplumedWrapper.a library. The corresponding macros are still subject to change and are not documented here.

  As written above, the plumed object now implements a reference counter.  Consider the following example
\verbatim
  plumed p=plumed_create();
  plumed_cmd(p,"init",NULL);
  plumed q=plumed_create_reference(p);
  plumed_finalize(p);
// at this stage, object q still exists
  plumed_cmd(q,"whatever",NULL);
  plumed_finalize(q);
// now plumed has been really finalized
\endverbatim

  In other words, every \ref plumed_create, \ref plumed_create_dlopen, \ref plumed_create_reference,
  \ref plumed_create_reference_f, and \ref plumed_create_reference_v call must be matched by a \ref plumed_finalize.
  Notice that in C++ whenever an object goes out of scope the reference counter
  will be decreased. In addition, consider that conversion from C/FORTRAN/void* to C++ implies calling a C++ constructor, that
  is increases the number of references by one. Converting from C++ to C/FORTRAN/void* instead does not call any constructor,
  that is the number of references is unchanged.

  The change in the behavior of C++ constructors means that the following code will behave in a backward incompatible manner:
\verbatim
  plumed p=plumed_create();
  plumed_cmd(p,"init",NULL);
  Plumed q(p);
  plumed_finalize(p);
// at this stage, object q still exists with PLUMED 2.5
// on the other hand, with PLUMED 2.4 object q refers to an
// already finalized object
  q.cmd("whatever",NULL);
\endverbatim

  Another difference is that the value of the variable `PLUMED_KERNEL` is read every time a new
  plumed object is instantiated. So, you might even use it to load different plumed versions
  simultaneously, although the preferred way to do this is using the function \ref plumed_create_dlopen.
  Notice that if you want to load multiple versions simultaneously you should load them in a local namespace.
  \ref plumed_create_dlopen does it automatically, whereas loading through env var `PLUMED_KERNEL` only does it if
  you also set env var `PLUMED_NAMESPACE=LOCAL`.

  Finally, a few functions have been added, namely:
  - Functions to find if a plumed object is valid
    (\ref plumed_valid(), \ref plumed_gvalid(), \ref PLMD::Plumed::valid(), and \ref PLMD::Plumed::gvalid()).
  - Functions to create a plumed object based on the path of a specific kernel
    (\ref plumed_create_dlopen() and \ref PLMD::Plumed::dlopen()).
  - Functions to create a plumed object referencing to another one, implementing a reference counter
    (\ref plumed_create_reference(), \ref plumed_create_reference_v(), \ref plumed_create_reference_f().

  Notice that the default way to extend functionalities is by adding cmd strings. This is a last resort, and all new
  functions should be explicitly motivated. Here's the addition:

  version=2, cmd_nothrow.

  This function accepts an extra argument `plumed_nothrow_handler*handler`.
  In case an exception is thrown withint plumed, it just calls `handler->handler(handler->ptr,code,message,opt)` and return.
  An alternative would have been to install an error handler (with a call to cmd("setErrorHandler")). However, the cost
  of doing it everytime Plumed::cmd is called is too high. On the other hand, installing it only at object construction
  is very risky since and object created in that way would not report any error if manipulated from the C interface.
  So, it looks like this is the only possibility.

  - declare a static function named NAME_static
  - declare a number of functions named NAME_ etc, with all possible

  - define the NAME_static function.
