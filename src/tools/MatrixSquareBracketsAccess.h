/**
Utility class to add [][] access

\tparam T The type of the matrix class.
\tparam C The type of the returned value.
\tparam I The type of the first index (default unsigned).
\tparam J The type of the second index (default unsigned).

It implements the trick described in C++ FAQ 13.12 to allow [][] access
to matrix-like classes, based on the (,) syntax, thus translating
[i][j] into (i,j).  In practice, one only needs to implement the (,) syntax and to inherit from
MatrixSquareBracketsAccess.
The first template parameter (T) should be the
class itself, the second (C) is the type of the returned value,
and the third (I) and fourth (J) are the types of the two indexes (unsigned by default).
As everything is inlined, no overhead is expected.

\verbatim

class MyMatrixClass:
  public MatrixSquareBracketsAccess<MyMatrixClass,double>
{
  double data[16];
public:
  double & operator ()(unsigned i,unsigned j){
    return data[4*i+j];
  }
  const double & operator ()(unsigned i,unsigned j)const{
    return data[4*i+j];
  }
};

int main(){
  MyMatrixClass m;
  m[0][1]=3.0;
  return 0;
}
