/**
\ingroup TOOLBOX
A class for storing a list that changes which members are active as a function of time.  It also
contains friends method that allows you to link two dynamic lists so that you can request
stuff from list2 in list1
A PLMD::DynamicList can be used to change what elements in a list should be looped over at any given
time. This class is, for the most part, used in tandem with PLMD::NeighbourList.  For complex reasons
related to the PLMD::MultiColvar object the dynamic list class is separate from PLMD::NeighbourList.
This is no bad thing though as there may be occasions where one needs to change the elements currently
involved in a calculation using some non neighbour list based method.  To be clear though PLMD::NeighbourList
will look after everything connected with PLMD::DynamicList other than the initial setup of PLMD::DynamicList
and the loops over the active elements of the list.

The essence of a dynamic list is as follows.  Consider the following loop:

\verbatim
std::vector<something> aa;
for(unsigned i=0;i<aa.size();++i){ aa[i].doSomething(); }
\endverbatim

This takes all the members in aa and does something or other to them - simple.  Now it may well
be that the precise set of things from aa that you want to do in any given time or place is not
always the same.  We can thus use dynamic lists to control what particular things are done are done
at a given time.  That is to say we can use PLMD::DynamicList to specify a subset of things from
aa to do at a given time.  This is done by:

\verbatim
DynamicList list; std::vector<something> aa; unsigned kk;
for(unsigned i=0;i<list.getNumberActive();++i){ kk=list[i]; aa[kk].doSomething(); }
\endverbatim

where we somewhere set up the list and make some decisions (in PLMD::NeighbourList for example) as to what elements
from aa are currently active.

\section Setup

Setting up a dynamic list is a matter of declaring it and passing a set of indices to it.  For the example
above with aa one can do this using:

\verbatim
DynamicList list;
for(unsigned i=0;i<aa.size();++i) list.addIndexToList( i );
\endverbatim

Doing this creates the list of all members.

\section arse1 Cycling over the full set of members

To cycle over the full set of members in the list one should do:

\verbatim
for(unsigned i=0;i<list.fullSize();++i){ kk=list(i); aa[kk].doSomething(); }
\endverbatim

If the DynamicList was set up as per the example above then this code is equivalent to:

\verbatim
for(unsigned i=0;i<aa.size();++i){ aa[i].doSomething(); }
\endverbatim

\section arse2 Activating and deactivating members

The important business comes when we start activating and deactivating members.  When we create
a dynamic list none of the members are active for business.  Hence, getNumberActive() returns 0.
There are four routines that we can use to change this situation.

<table align="center" frame="void" width="95%" cellpadding="5%">
<tr>
<td width="5%"> activateAll() </td> <td> make all members active </td>
</tr><tr>
<td> activate(i) </td> <td> make the ith element of the list active (in the example above this mean we doSomething() for element i of aa) </td>
</tr><tr>
<td> deactivateAll() </td> <td> make all members inactive </td>
</tr><tr>
<td> deactivate(i) </td> <td> make th ith element of the list active (in the example above this mean we dont doSomething() for element i of aa) </td>
</tr>
</table>

Once you have activated and deactivated members to your hearts content you can then update the dynamic list using
PLMD::DynamicList::updateActiveMembers().  Once this is done you can loop over only the members you have specifically
made active using:

\verbatim
DynamicList list;
for(unsigned i=0;i<list.getNumberActive();++i){ kk=list[i]; aa[kk].doSomething(); }
\endverbatim

as was described above.

\section arse3 Using MPI

If your loop is distributed over processesors you can still use dynamic lists to activate and deactivate members.
When running with mpi however you must call PLMD::DynamicList::setupMPICommunication during initialization.  To
gather the members that have been activated/deactivated during the running of all the processes on all the nodes
you must call PLMD::DynamicList::mpi_gatherActiveMembers in place of PLMD::DynamicList::updateActiveMembers.

\section arse4 A final note

When using dynamic_lists we strongly recommend that you first compile without the -DNDEBUG flag.  When this
flag is not present many checks are performed inside the dynamic list class, which will help you ensure that
the dynamic list is used correctly.
