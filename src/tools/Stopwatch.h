/**
\ingroup TOOLBOX
Class implementing stopwatch to time execution.

Each instance of this class is a container which
can keep track of several named stopwatches at
the same time. Access to the stopwatches
is obtained using start(), stop(), pause() methods,
giving as a parameter the name of the specific stopwatch.
Also an empty string can be used (un-named stopwatch).
Finally, all the times can be logged using << operator

\verbatim
#include "Stopwatch.h"

int main(){
  Stopwatch sw;
  sw.start();

  sw.start("initialization");
// do initialization ...
  sw.stop("initialization");

  for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
    sw.start("loop");
// do calculation
    sw.stop("loop");
  }

  sw.stop();
  return 0;
}

\endverbatim

Using pause a stopwatch can be put on hold until
the next start:

\verbatim
#include "Stopwatch.h"

int main(){
  Stopwatch sw;
  sw.start();

  sw.start("initialization");
// do initialization ...
  sw.stop("initialization");

  for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
    sw.start("loop");
// do calculation
    sw.pause("loop");
// here goes something that we do not want to include
    sw.start("loop");
// do calculation
    sw.stop("loop");
  }

  sw.stop();
  return 0;
}

\endverbatim

Notice that as of PLUMED 2.5 it is possible to use a slightly modified
interface that allow for exception safety. In practice,
one can replace a pair of calls to Stopwatch::start() and Stopwatch::stop()
with a single call to Stopwatch::startStop(). This call will return an object
that, when goes out of scope, will stop the timer.

\notice The exception safety interace is highly recommended since it allows
to make sure that stopwatches are started and stopped consistently.

For instance the following
code
\verbatim
  {
    sw.start("A");
  // any code
    sw.stop("A");
  }
\endverbatim
can be replaced with
\verbatim
  {
    auto sww=sw.startStop("A");
  // any code

  // stopwatch is stopped when sww goes out of scope
  }
\endverbatim
Similarly, Stopwatch::startPause() can be used to replace a pair of
Stopwatch::start() and Stopwatch::pause().

The older syntax (explicitly calling `Stopwatch::start()` and `Stopwatch::pause()`) is still
allowed for backward compatibility.

Notice that the returned object is of type `Stopwatch::Handler`.
You might be willing to explicitly declare a `Stopwatch::Handler` (instead of using `auto`)
when you want to conditionally start the stopwatch. For instance:
\verbatim
  {
    Stopwatch::Handler handler;
    if(you_want_to_time_this) handler=sw.startStop();
    ... do something ...
  }
  // in case it was started, the stopwatch will stop here, at the end of the block
  // in case it was not started, nothing will happen
\endverbatim

A `Stopwatch::Handler` can not be copied but it can be moved (it behaves like a unique_ptr).
Moving it explicitly allows one to transfer it to another `Stopwatch::Handler` with a different scope.
For instance, in case you want to conditionally stop the stopwatch you might use something like this:
\verbatim
  {
    Stopwatch::Handler handler;
    if(you_want_to_time_this) handler=sw.startStop();
    ... do something ...
    if(you_want_to_stop_here) auto h2=std::move(handler);
    // the previous instruction moves handler to h2 that is then destroyed, stopping the watch
    // notice that if the stop was not started it will not stop.
    ... do something else ...
  }
  // in case it is running, the stopwatch will stop here, at the end of the block
\endverbatim

Finally, notice that in order to write the timers on an output file when the
Stopwatch is destroyed, one can store a reference to a PLMD::Log by passing it
to the Stopwatch constructor.
This will make sure timers are written also in case of a premature end.
