\ingroup INHERIT
This abstract base class should be used if you are writing some method that calculates an "average" from a set of
trajectory frames.  Notice that we use the word average very broadly here and state that even dimensionality
reduction algorithms calculate an "average."  In other words, what we mean by average is that the method is going
to take in data from each trajectory frame and only calculate the final quantity once a certain amount of data has
been collected.
