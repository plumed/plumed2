//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC RANDOM_EXCHANGES
/*
Set random pattern for exchanges.

This command is typically used if you are using the bias exchange method that is
discussed in the paper in the bibliography.  When it is present it tells PLUMED
not do do exchanges between replicas with consecutive indices and instad to use
use a random pattern.

The following three example input files show how one can run a bias exchange
metadynamics simulation using a different angle in each replica.
Exchanges are randomly tried between replicas 0-1, 0-2 and 1-2

Here is plumed.0.dat

```plumed
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
METAD ARG=t HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
```

Here is plumed.1.dat

```plumed
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t: TORSION ATOMS=2,3,4,5
METAD ARG=t HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
```

Here is plumed.2.dat

```plumed
RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t: TORSION ATOMS=3,4,5,6
METAD ARG=t HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
```

Notice that you can perform the same calculation with the following single PLUMED input file:

```plumed
#SETTINGS NREPLICAS=3

RANDOM_EXCHANGES
t1: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
t2: TORSION ATOMS=2,3,4,5
t3: TORSION ATOMS=3,4,5,6
METAD ARG=@replicas:t1,t2,t3 HEIGHT=0.1 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.3
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Multi replica simulations are presently only working with gromacs.

> [!CAUTION]
> The directive should appear in the input file for every replica. If SEED is specified, it
> should be the same in all input files.
