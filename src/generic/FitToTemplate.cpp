//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC FIT_TO_TEMPLATE
/*
This action is used to align a molecule to a template.

This can be used to move the coordinates stored in plumed
so as to be aligned with a provided template in PDB format. Pdb should contain
also weights for alignment (see the format of PDB files used e.g. for \ref RMSD).
Make sure your PDB file is correctly formatted as explained \ref pdbreader "in this page".
Weights for displacement are ignored, since no displacement is computed here.
Notice that all atoms (not only those in the template) are aligned.
To see what effect try
the \ref DUMPATOMS directive to output the atomic positions.

Also notice that PLUMED propagate forces correctly so that you can add a bias on a CV computed
after alignment. For many CVs this has no effect, but in some case the alignment can
change the result. Examples are:
- \ref POSITION CV since it is affected by a rigid shift of the system.
- \ref DISTANCE CV with COMPONENTS. Since the alignment could involve a rotation (with TYPE=OPTIMAL) the actual components could be different
  from the original ones.
- \ref CELL components for a similar reason.
- \ref DISTANCE from a \ref FIXEDATOM, provided the fixed atom is introduced _after_ the \ref FIT_TO_TEMPLATE action.

\attention
The implementation of TYPE=OPTIMAL is available but should be considered in testing phase. Please report any
strange behavior.

\attention
This directive modifies the stored position at the precise moment
it is executed. This means that only collective variables
which are below it in the input script will see the corrected positions.
As a general rule, put it at the top of the input file. Also, unless you
know exactly what you are doing, leave the default stride (1), so that
this action is performed at every MD step.

When running with periodic boundary conditions, the atoms should be
in the proper periodic image. This is done automatically since PLUMED 2.5,
by considering the ordered list of atoms and rebuilding the molecules using a procedure
that is equivalent to that done in \ref WHOLEMOLECULES . Notice that
rebuilding is local to this action. This is different from \ref WHOLEMOLECULES
which actually modifies the coordinates stored in PLUMED.

In case you want to recover the old behavior you should use the NOPBC flag.
In that case you need to take care that atoms are in the correct
periodic image.

\par Examples

Align the atomic position to a template then print them.
The following example is only translating the system so as
to align the center of mass of a molecule to the one in the reference
structure `ref.pdb`:
\plumedfile
# dump coordinates before fitting, to see the difference:
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump-before.xyz ATOMS=1-20

# fit coordinates to ref.pdb template
# this is a "TYPE=SIMPLE" fit, so that only translations are used.
FIT_TO_TEMPLATE STRIDE=1 REFERENCE=ref.pdb TYPE=SIMPLE

# dump coordinates after fitting, to see the difference:
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump-after.xyz ATOMS=1-20
\endplumedfile

The following example instead performs a rototranslational fit.
\plumedfile
# dump coordinates before fitting, to see the difference:
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump-before.xyz ATOMS=1-20

# fit coordinates to ref.pdb template
# this is a "TYPE=OPTIMAL" fit, so that rototranslations are used.
FIT_TO_TEMPLATE STRIDE=1 REFERENCE=ref.pdb TYPE=OPTIMAL

# dump coordinates after fitting, to see the difference:
DUMPATOMS FILE=dump-after.xyz ATOMS=1-20
\endplumedfile

In both these cases the reference structure should be provided in a reference pdb file such as the one below:

\auxfile{ref.pdb}
ATOM      8  HT3 ALA     2      -1.480  -1.560   1.212  1.00  1.00      DIA  H
ATOM      9  CAY ALA     2      -0.096   2.144  -0.669  1.00  1.00      DIA  C
ATOM     10  HY1 ALA     2       0.871   2.385  -0.588  1.00  1.00      DIA  H
ATOM     12  HY3 ALA     2      -0.520   2.679  -1.400  1.00  1.00      DIA  H
ATOM     14  OY  ALA     2      -1.139   0.931  -0.973  1.00  1.00      DIA  O
END
\endauxfile

In the following example you see two completely equivalent way
to restrain an atom close to a position that is defined in the reference
frame of an aligned molecule. You could for instance use this command to calculate the
position of the center of mass of a ligand after having aligned the atoms to the reference
frame of the protein that is determined by aligning the atoms in the protein to the coordinates
provided in the file ref.pdb
\plumedfile
# center of the ligand:
center: CENTER ATOMS=100-110

FIT_TO_TEMPLATE REFERENCE=ref.pdb TYPE=OPTIMAL

# place a fixed atom in the protein reference coordinates:
fix: FIXEDATOM AT=1.0,1.1,1.0

# take the distance between the fixed atom and the center of the ligand
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=center,fix

# apply a restraint
RESTRAINT ARG=d AT=0.0 KAPPA=100.0
\endplumedfile

Notice that you could have obtained an (almost) identical result by adding a fictitious
atom to `ref.pdb` with the serial number corresponding to the atom labelled `center` (there is no automatic way
to get it, but in this example it should be the number of atoms of the system plus one),
and properly setting the weights for alignment and displacement in \ref RMSD.
There are two differences to be expected:
(ab) \ref FIT_TO_TEMPLATE might be slower since it has to rototranslate all the available atoms and
(b) variables employing periodic boundary conditions (such as \ref DISTANCE without `NOPBC`, as in the example above)
  are allowed after \ref FIT_TO_TEMPLATE, whereas \ref RMSD expects the issues related to the periodic boundary conditions to be already solved.
The latter means that before the \ref RMSD statement one should use \ref WRAPAROUND or \ref WHOLEMOLECULES to properly place
the ligand.
