/*
Terminate plumed input.

Can be used to effectively comment out the rest of the input file.
It can be useful to quickly ignore part of a long input file. However,
one should keep in mind that when opening the file it might be difficult to
find where the commented out part begins. Regular comments (with `#`) are
usually easier to read. Notice that \ref VimSyntax "VIM syntax" should be able
to detect this command and properly mark the rest of the file as a comment,
although since vim doesn't parse the whole file it might fail in doing so for long
input files.

\par Examples

\plumedfile
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
PRINT ARG=d FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=10
ENDPLUMED
commands here are ignored
PRINT ARG=d FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=1
\endplumedfile
