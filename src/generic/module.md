This module contains a range of generic PLUMED actions that can be used in many different types of calculation.  For example, 
many of the commands in this module are used to print data that has been calculated by PLUMED to files.

This module also contains functionalities such as [WHOLEMOLECULES](WHOLEMOLECULES.md) or [WRAPAROUND](WRAPAROUND.md) that 
can be used to manipulate the positions that are passed from the MD code to PLUMED. Additionally, this module contains features
such as [CONSTANT](CONSTANT.md) and [PDB2CONSTANT](PDB2CONSTANT.md) that can be used to store constant values.

The last set of featuers in this module are [COLLECT](COLLECT.md), [ACCUMULATE](ACCUMULATE.md), [AVERAGE](AVERAGE.md) and [GATHER_REPLICAS](GATHER_REPLICAS.md)
that can be used to gather data from multiple frames in the trajectory or from multiple replicas for further analysis.
