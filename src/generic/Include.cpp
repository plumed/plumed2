//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC INCLUDE
/*
Includes an external input file, similar to #include in C preprocessor.

Useful to split very large plumed.dat files. Notice that in PLUMED 2.4 this action
cannot be used before the initial setup part of the file (e.g. in the part with \ref UNITS, \ref MOLINFO, etc).
As of PLUMED 2.5, \ref INCLUDE can be used in any position of the file.

\par Examples

This input:
\plumedfile
c1: COM ATOMS=1-100
c2: COM ATOMS=101-202
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2
PRINT ARG=d
\endplumedfile
can be replaced with this input:
\plumedfile
INCLUDE FILE=pippo.dat
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2
PRINT ARG=d
\endplumedfile
where the content of file pippo.dat is
\plumedfile
#SETTINGS FILENAME=pippo.dat
# this is pippo.dat
c1: COM ATOMS=1-100
c2: COM ATOMS=101-202
\endplumedfile

The files in this example are rather short, but imagine a case like this one:
\plumedfile
INCLUDE FILE=groups.dat
c: COORDINATION GROUPA=groupa GROUPB=groupb R_0=0.5
METAD ARG=c HEIGHT=0.2 PACE=100 SIGMA=0.2 BIASFACTOR=5
\endplumedfile
Here `groups.dat` could be a huge file containing group definitions.  This groups.dat file might look something
like the following example but with more atom indices in the groups.
\plumedfile
#SETTINGS FILENAME=groups.dat
# this is groups.dat
groupa: GROUP ...
  ATOMS={
    10
    50
    60
    70
    80
    120
  }
...
groupb: GROUP ...
  ATOMS={
    11
    51
    61
    71
    81
    121
  }
...
\endplumedfile
So, included files are the best place where one can store long definitions.

Another case where INCLUDE is very useful is when running multi-replica simulations.
Here different replicas might have different input files, but perhaps a large part of the
input is shared. This part can be put in a common included file. For instance you could have
`common.dat`:
\plumedfile
#SETTINGS FILENAME=common.dat
# this is common.dat
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
\endplumedfile
Then `plumed.0.dat`:
\plumedfile
# this is plumed.0.dat
INCLUDE FILE=common.dat
RESTRAINT ARG=t AT=1.0 KAPPA=10
\endplumedfile
And `plumed.1.dat`:
\plumedfile
# this is plumed.1.dat
INCLUDE FILE=common.dat
RESTRAINT ARG=t AT=1.2 KAPPA=10
\endplumedfile

\warning
Remember that when using multi replica simulations whenever plumed tried to open
a file for reading it looks for a file with the replica suffix first.
This is true also for files opened by INCLUDE!

As an example, the same result of the inputs above could have been obtained using
the following `plumed.dat` file:
\plumedfile
#SETTINGS NREPLICAS=2
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
INCLUDE FILE=other.inc
\endplumedfile
Then `other.0.inc`:
\plumedfile
#SETTINGS FILENAME=other.0.inc
# this is other.0.inc
RESTRAINT ARG=t AT=1.0 KAPPA=10
\endplumedfile
And `other.1.inc`:
\plumedfile
#SETTINGS FILENAME=other.1.inc
# this is other.1.inc
RESTRAINT ARG=t AT=1.2 KAPPA=10
\endplumedfile
