/*
Allow PLUMED to use collective variables computed in the MD engine.

This feature requires the MD engine to use special instructions to pass to PLUMED the value of
some pre-computed collective variable. Check the documentation of the MD code to find out which
collective variables can be computed and passed to PLUMED. These variables can then be accessed by
name using the EXTRACV action.

\par Examples

This example takes the lambda variable pre-computed in GROMACS and apply to it a restraint to keep
it close to the value 3.
