//+PLUMEDOC COLVAR COORDINATION
/*
Calculate coordination numbers.

This keyword can be used to calculate the number of contacts between two groups of atoms
and is defined as
\f[
\sum_{i\in A} \sum_{i\in B} s_{ij}
\f]
where \f$s_{ij}\f$ is 1 if the contact between atoms \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$ is formed,
zero otherwise.
In actuality, \f$s_{ij}\f$ is replaced with a switching function so as to ensure that the calculated CV has continuous derivatives.
The default switching function is:
\f[
s_{ij} = \frac{ 1 - \left(\frac{{\bf r}_{ij}-d_0}{r_0}\right)^n } { 1 - \left(\frac{{\bf r}_{ij}-d_0}{r_0}\right)^m }
\f]
but it can be changed using the optional SWITCH option.

To make your calculation faster you can use a neighbor list, which makes it that only a
relevant subset of the pairwise distance are calculated at every step.

If GROUPB is empty, it will sum the \f$\frac{N(N-1)}{2}\f$ pairs in GROUPA. This avoids computing
twice permuted indexes (e.g. pair (i,j) and (j,i)) thus running at twice the speed.

Notice that if there are common atoms between GROUPA and GROUPB the switching function should be
equal to one. These "self contacts" are discarded by plumed (since version 2.1),
so that they actually count as "zero".


\par Examples

The following example instructs plumed to calculate the total coordination number of the atoms in group 1-10 with the atoms in group 20-100.  For atoms 1-10 coordination numbers are calculated that count the number of atoms from the second group that are within 0.3 nm of the central atom.  A neighbor list is used to make this calculation faster, this neighbor list is updated every 100 steps.
\plumedfile
COORDINATION GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=20-100 R_0=0.3 NLIST NL_CUTOFF=0.5 NL_STRIDE=100
\endplumedfile

The following is a dummy example which should compute the value 0 because the self interaction
of atom 1 is skipped. Notice that in plumed 2.0 "self interactions" were not skipped, and the
same calculation should return 1.
\plumedfile
c: COORDINATION GROUPA=1 GROUPB=1 R_0=0.3
PRINT ARG=c STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile

Here's an example that shows what happens when providing COORDINATION with
a single group:
\plumedfile
# define some huge group:
group: GROUP ATOMS=1-1000
# Here's coordination of a group against itself:
c1: COORDINATION GROUPA=group GROUPB=group R_0=0.3
# Here's coordination within a single group:
x: COORDINATION GROUPA=group R_0=0.3
# This is just multiplying times 2 the variable x:
c2: COMBINE ARG=x COEFFICIENTS=2 PERIODIC=NO

# the two variables c1 and c2 should be identical, but the calculation of c2 is twice faster
# since it runs on half of the pairs.
PRINT ARG=c1,c2 STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile
