Calculate eRMSD with respect to a reference structure.

eRMSD is a metric developed for measuring distances between three-dimensional RNA structures.
The standard RMSD measure is highly inaccurate when measuring distances among three-dimensional
structures of nucleic acids.
It is not unusual, for example, that two RNA structures with low RMSD (i.e. less than 0.4nm) display a completely different network of base-base interactions.

eRMSD measures the distance between structures by considering only the relative positions and orientations of nucleobases. The eRMSD can be considered as a vectorial version of contact maps and it is calculated as follows:

1. Set up a local reference system in the center of the six-membered ring of each nucleobase in a molecule.
   The xy plane lies on the plane of the nucleobase, and it is oriented such that the Watson-Crick interaction is always at \f$\theta\approx 60^{\circ}\f$.

2. Calculate all pairwise distance vectors \f$\vec{r}_{i,j}\f$ among base centers.

3. Rescale distance vectors as \f$\tilde{\vec{r}}_{i,j}=(r_x/a,r_y/a,r_z/b)\f$, where  a=b=5 \f$\r{A}\f$, c=3 \f$\r{A}\f$. This rescaling has the effect of weighting more deviations on the z-axis with respect to the x/y directions.

4. Calculate the G vectors

\f[
\vec{G}(\tilde{\vec{r}}) = (\sin(\gamma \tilde{r}) \tilde{r}_x/\tilde{r},\sin(\gamma \tilde{r}) \tilde{r}_y/\tilde{r},\sin(\gamma \tilde{r}) \tilde{r}_z/\tilde{r}, 1+\cos(\gamma \tilde{r})) \times
\frac{\Theta(\tilde{r}_{cutoff}-\tilde{r})}{\gamma}
\f]

Here, \f$ \gamma = \pi/\tilde{r}_{cutoff}\f$ and \f$ \Theta \f$ is the Heaviside step function. The default cutoff is set to 2.4.

5. The eRMSD between two structures \f$ \alpha \f$ and \f$ \beta \f$ reads

\f[
eRMSD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j,k} \vert \vec{G}(\tilde{\vec{r}}_{jk}^{\alpha}) - \vec{G}(\tilde{\vec{r}}_{jk}^{\beta}) \vert^2 }
\f]

Using the default cutoff, two structures with eRMSD of 0.7 or lower can be considered as significantly similar. A full description of the eRMSD can be found in \cite bott14

ERMSD is computed using the position of three atoms on the 6-membered ring of each involved nucleobase. The atoms should be:
- C2,C4,C6 for pyrimdines
- C2,C6,C4 for purines

The different order for purines and pyrimidines is fundamental and allows you to compute ERMSD between structures with different
sequences as well! Notice that the simplest way to avoid mistakes in choosing these atoms is to use the `@lcs-#` strings
as shown in the examples (see also \ref MOLINFO).

\warning Notice that the ERMSD implemented here is not integrated with the other metrics in plumed. As a consequence, it is not (yet) possible
to e.g. build path collective variables using ERMSD

\warning Notice that ERMSD expect a single molecule and makes coordinate whole before anything else. As such, results might be unexpected
for a multi molecular system.

\par Examples

Calculate the eRMSD from reference structure reference.pdb using the default cutoff (2.4). The list of residues involved in the calculation has to be specified. In this example, the eRMSD is calculated
considering residues 1,2,3,4,5,6.
