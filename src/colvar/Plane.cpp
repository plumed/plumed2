//+PLUMEDOC COLVAR PLANE
/*
Calculate the plane perpendicular to two vectors in order to represent the orientation of a planar molecule.

To calculate the orientation of the plane connecting atoms 1, 2 and 3 you use an input like this:

```plumed
p: PLANE ATOMS=1,2,3
PRINT ARG=p.x,p.y,p.z FILE=colvar
```

The three components, p.x, p.y and p.z, output by the PLANE action here are the x, y and z components of the normal
vector to the plane that is obtained by taking the cross product between the vector connecting atoms 1 and 2 and
the vector connecting atoms 2 and 3.  Notice that the default here is to evaluate these two vectors in a way that takes
any periodic boundary conditions (PBC) into account. If you wish to disregard the PBC you can use the NOPBC flag as shown in the following input:

```plumed
p: PLANE ATOMS=1,2,3 NOPBC
PRINT ARG=p.x,p.y,p.z FILE=colvar
```

To calculate the cross product of the vector connecting atoms 1 and 2 and the vector connecting atoms 3 and 4 you use
an input like this:

```plumed
p: PLANE ATOMS=1,2,3,4
PRINT ARG=p.x,p.y,p.z FILE=colvar
```

If you have multiple molecules and wish to determine the orientations of the planes containing all them with one line of PLUMED
input you can use an input like this:

```plumed
p: PLANE ATOMS1=1,2,3 ATOMS2=4,5,6 ATOMS3=7,8,9 ATOMS4=10,11,12
PRINT ARG=p.x,p.y,p.z FILE=colvar
```

The output from this command consists of 3 vectors with 4 components. These vectors, p.x, p.y and p.z, contain the x, y and z components
of the normals to the planes of the molecules.  Commands similar to this are useful for variables that can be used to monitor
nucleation of molecular crystals such as [SMAC](SMAC.md).
