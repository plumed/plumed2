//+PLUMEDOC BIAS BIASVALUE
/*
Takes the value of one variable and use it as a bias

This is the simplest possible bias: when you use this method the bias potential is set equal to the scalar-valued argument that was input.
This action is useful for creating custom biasing potential, e.g. if you apply a function (see [function module](module_function.md))
to some collective variable then use the value of this function directly as a bias.

This action is also useful for testing that forces are being calculated correctly.  If I wanted to test whether the derivatives calculated
by the [DISTANCE](DISTANCE.md) action are computed correctly I would write a PLUMED input like this one:

```plumed
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
BIASVALUE ARG=d1
```

I would then run a calculation using [driver](driver.md) with the following input:

```plumed
plumed driver --ixyz traj.xyz --debug-forces forces.num
```

This outputs a file with two columns that both contain the forces that are acting upon the atoms.  The first set of forces output are the
analytic forces that are implemented within PLUMED.  The second set of forces are calcluated numerically using finite difference.  If you
method is implemented correctly these two sets of forces should be the same.

## Examples

The following input tells plumed to use the value of the distance between atoms 3 and 5
and the value of the distance between atoms 2 and 4 as biases.
It then tells plumed to print the energy of the restraint

```plumed
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE ATOMS=3,6 LABEL=d2
BIASVALUE ARG=d1,d2 LABEL=b
PRINT ARG=d1,d2,b.d1_bias,b.d2_bias
```

Another thing one can do is ask the system to follow a circle in sin/cos in accordance with a time dependence

```plumed
t: TIME
# this just print cos and sin of time
cos: MATHEVAL ARG=t VAR=t FUNC=cos(t) PERIODIC=NO
sin: MATHEVAL ARG=t VAR=t FUNC=sin(t) PERIODIC=NO
c1: COM ATOMS=1,2
c2: COM ATOMS=3,4
d: DISTANCE COMPONENTS ATOMS=c1,c2
PRINT ARG=t,cos,sin,d.x,d.y,d.z STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
# this calculates sine and cosine of a projected component of distance
mycos:  MATHEVAL ARG=d.x,d.y  VAR=x,y   FUNC=x/sqrt(x*x+y*y) PERIODIC=NO
mysin:  MATHEVAL ARG=d.x,d.y  VAR=x,y   FUNC=y/sqrt(x*x+y*y) PERIODIC=NO
# this creates a moving spring so that the system follows a circle-like dynamics
# but it is not a bias, it is a simple value now
vv1:  MATHEVAL ARG=mycos,mysin,cos,sin VAR=mc,ms,c,s  FUNC=100*((mc-c)^2+(ms-s)^2) PERIODIC=NO
# this takes the value calculated with matheval and uses as a bias
cc: BIASVALUE ARG=vv1
# some printout
PRINT ARG=t,cos,sin,d.x,d.y,d.z,mycos,mysin,cc.vv1_bias STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
```
