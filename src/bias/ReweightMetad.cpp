//+PLUMEDOC REWEIGHTING REWEIGHT_METAD
/*
Calculate the weights configurations should contribute to the histogram in a simulation in which a metadynamics bias acts upon the system.

This command allows you to use the reweighting algorithm discussed in \cite PratyushReweighting when constructing a histogram
of the configurations visited during a metadynamics simulation.

\par Examples

In the following example there is a metadynamics bias acting on the distance between atoms 1 and 2.  Clearly, this
bias will have an effect on the region of phase space that will be sampled when an MD simulation is
run using this variable.  Consequently, when the histogram as a function of the angle, \f$a\f$, is accumulated,
we use reweighting into order to discount the effect of the bias from our final histogram.  We do not use
\ref REWEIGHT_BIAS here, however, as the bias changes with time.  We thus use the reweighting algorithm for
metadynamics instead.  Notice also that we have to specify how often we would like to calculate the c(t) reweighting
factor and the grid over which we calculate c(t) in the input to the METAD command.
