//+PLUMEDOC REWEIGHTING REWEIGHT_BIAS
/*
Calculate weights for ensemble averages that negate the effect the bias has on the region of phase space explored

If a static or pseudo-static bias \f$V(x,t')\f$ is acting on
the system we can remove the bias and get the unbiased probability distribution using:

\f[
\langle P(s',t) \rangle = \frac{ \sum_{t'}^t \delta( s(x) - s' ) \exp\left( +\frac{V(x,t')}{k_B T} \right) }{ \sum_t'^t \exp\left( +\frac{V(x,t')}{k_B T} \right) }
\f]

The weights calculated by this action are equal to \f$\exp\left( +\frac{V(x,t')}{k_B T} \right)\f$ these weights can then be used in any action
that computes ensemble averages.  For example this action can be used in tandem with \ref HISTOGRAM or \ref AVERAGE.

\par Examples

In the following example there is a fixed restraint on the distance between atoms 1 and 2.  Clearly, this
restraint will have an effect on the region of phase space that will be sampled when an MD simulation is
run using this variable.  Consequently, when the histogram as a function of the distance, \f$x\f$, is accumulated,
we use reweighting into order to discount the effect of the bias from our final histogram.
