//+PLUMEDOC COLVAR PATH
/*
Path collective variables with a more flexible framework for the distance metric being used.

The Path Collective Variables developed by Branduardi and co-workers \cite brand07 allow one
to compute the progress along a high-dimensional path and the distance from the high-dimensional
path.  The progress along the path (s) is computed using:

\f[
s = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N i \exp( -\lambda R[X - X_i] ) }{ \sum_{i=1}^N \exp( -\lambda R[X - X_i] ) }
\f]

while the distance from the path (z) is measured using:

\f[
z = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \ln\left[ \sum_{i=1}^N \exp( -\lambda R[X - X_i] ) \right]
\f]

In these expressions \f$N\f$ high-dimensional frames (\f$X_i\f$) are used to describe the path in the high-dimensional
space. The two expressions above are then functions of the distances from each of the high-dimensional frames \f$R[X - X_i]\f$.
Within PLUMED there are multiple ways to define the distance from a high-dimensional configuration.  You could calculate
the RMSD distance or you could calculate the amount by which a set of collective variables change.  As such this implementation
of the path CV allows one to use all the difference distance metrics that are discussed in \ref dists. This is as opposed to
the alternative implementation of path (\ref PATHMSD) which is a bit faster but which only allows one to use the RMSD distance.

The \f$s\f$ and \f$z\f$ variables are calculated using the above formulas by default.  However, there is an alternative method
of calculating these collective variables, which is detailed in \cite bernd-path.  This alternative method uses the tools of
geometry (as opposed to algebra, which is used in the equations above).  In this alternative formula the progress along the path
\f$s\f$ is calculated using:

\f[
s = i_2 + \textrm{sign}(i_2-i_1) \frac{ \sqrt{( \mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_2 )^2 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2(|\mathbf{v}_1|^2 - |\mathbf{v}_2|^2) } }{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2} - \frac{\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_3 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2}{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2}
\f]

where \f$\mathbf{v}_1\f$ and \f$\mathbf{v}_3\f$ are the vectors connecting the current position to the closest and second closest node of the path,
respectfully and \f$i_1\f$ and \f$i_2\f$ are the projections of the closest and second closest frames of the path. \f$\mathbf{v}_2\f$, meanwhile, is the
vector connecting the closest frame to the second closest frame.  The distance from the path, \f$z\f$ is calculated using:

\f[
z = \sqrt{ \left[ |\mathbf{v}_1|^2 - |\mathbf{v}_2| \left( \frac{ \sqrt{( \mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_2 )^2 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2(|\mathbf{v}_1|^2 - |\mathbf{v}_2|^2) } }{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2} - \frac{\mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_3 - |\mathbf{v}_3|^2}{2|\mathbf{v}_3|^2} \right) \right]^2 }
\f]

The symbols here are as they were for \f$s\f$.  If you would like to use these equations to calculate \f$s\f$ and \f$z\f$ then you should use the GPATH flag.
The values of \f$s\f$ and \f$z\f$ can then be referenced using the gspath and gzpath labels.

\par Examples

In the example below the path is defined using RMSD distance from frames.

\plumedfile
p1: PATH REFERENCE=file.pdb TYPE=OPTIMAL LAMBDA=500.0
PRINT ARG=p1.spath,p1.zpath STRIDE=1 FILE=colvar FMT=%8.4f
\endplumedfile

The reference frames in the path are defined in the pdb file shown below.  In this frame
each configuration in the path is separated by a line containing just the word END.

\endauxfile

In the example below the path is defined using the values of two torsional angles (t1 and t2).
In addition, the \f$s\f$ and \f$z\f$ are calculated using the geometric expressions described
above rather than the algebraic expressions that are used by default.

\plumedfile
t1: TORSION ATOMS=5,7,9,15
t2: TORSION ATOMS=7,9,15,17
pp: PATH TYPE=EUCLIDEAN REFERENCE=epath.pdb GPATH NOSPATH NOZPATH
PRINT ARG=pp.* FILE=colvar
\endplumedfile

Notice that the LAMBDA parameter is not required here as we are not calculating \f$s\f$ and \f$s\f$
using the algebraic formulas defined earlier.  The positions of the frames in the path are defined
in the file epath.pdb.  An extract from this file looks as shown below.

\auxfile{epath.pdb}
REMARK ARG=t1,t2 t1=-4.25053  t2=3.88053
END
REMARK ARG=t1,t2 t1=-4.11     t2=3.75
END
REMARK ARG=t1,t2 t1=-3.96947  t2=3.61947
END
\endauxfile

The remarks in this pdb file tell PLUMED the labels that are being used to define the position in the
high dimensional space and the values that these arguments have at each point on the path.
