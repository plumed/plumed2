/*
Calculate the x components of the vectors connecting one or many pairs of atoms.
You can then calculate functions of the distribution of values such as the minimum, the number less than a certain quantity and so on.

\par Examples

The following input tells plumed to calculate the x-component of the vector connecting atom 3 to atom 5 and
the x-component of the vector connecting atom 1 to atom 2.  The minimum of these two quantities is then
printed
\plumedfile
d1: XDISTANCES ATOMS1=3,5 ATOMS2=1,2 MIN={BETA=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.min
\endplumedfile
(See also \ref PRINT).


The following input tells plumed to calculate the x-component of the vector connecting atom 3 to atom 5 and
the x-component of the vector connecting atom 1 to atom 2.  The number of values that are
less than 0.1nm is then printed to a file.
\plumedfile
d1: XDISTANCES ATOMS1=3,5 ATOMS2=1,2 LESS_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.lessthan
\endplumedfile
(See also \ref PRINT \ref switchingfunction).

The following input tells plumed to calculate the x-components of all the distinct vectors that can be created
between atoms 1, 2 and 3 (i.e. the vectors between atoms 1 and 2, atoms 1 and 3 and atoms 2 and 3).
The average of these quantities is then calculated.
\plumedfile
d1: XDISTANCES GROUP=1-3 MEAN
PRINT ARG=d1.mean
\endplumedfile
(See also \ref PRINT)

The following input tells plumed to calculate all the vectors connecting the the atoms in GROUPA to the atoms in GROUPB.
In other words the vector between atoms 1 and 2 and the vector between atoms 1 and 3.  The number of values
more than 0.1 is then printed to a file.
\plumedfile
d1: XDISTANCES GROUPA=1 GROUPB=2,3 MORE_THAN={RATIONAL R_0=0.1}
