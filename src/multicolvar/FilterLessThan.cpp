//+PLUMEDOC MTRANSFORMS MTRANSFORM_LESS
/*
This action can be used to transform the colvar values calculated by a multicovar using a switching function

In this action each colvar, \f$s_i\f$, calculated by \ref mcolv is transformed by a \ref switchingfunction function that
is equal to one if the colvar is less than a certain target value and which is equal to zero otherwise.
It is important to understand the distinction between what is done here and what is done by \ref MFILTER_LESS.
In \ref MFILTER_LESS a weight, \f$w_i\f$ for the colvar is calculated using the \ref switchingfunction.  If one calculates the
MEAN for \ref MFILTER_LESS one is thus calculating:

\f[
\mu = \frac{ \sum_i \sigma(s_i) s_i }{\sum_i \simga(s_i) }
\f]

where \f$\sigma\f$ is the \ref switchingfunction.  In this action by contrast the colvar is being transformed by
the \ref switchingfunction.  If one thus calculates a MEAN for this action one computes:

\f[
\mu = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N \simga(s_i) }{ N }
\f]

In other words, you are calculating the mean for the transformed colvar.

\par Examples

The following input gives an example of how a MTRANSFORM_LESS action can be used to duplicate
functionality that is elsewhere in PLUMED.

\plumedfile
DISTANCES ...
 GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20
 LABEL=d1
... DISTANCES
MTRANSFORM_LESS DATA=d1 SWITCH={GAUSSIAN D_0=1.5 R_0=0.00001}
\endplumedfile

In this case you can achieve the same result by using:

\plumedfile
DISTANCES ...
 GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20
 LESS_THAN={GAUSSIAN D_0=1.5 R_0=0.00001}
... DISTANCES
\endplumedfile
(see \ref DISTANCES)

The advantage of MTRANSFORM_LESS comes, however, if you want to use transformed colvars as input
for \ref MULTICOLVARDENS

/*
This action can be used to filter the distribution of colvar values in a multicolvar so that one can compute the mean and so on for only those multicolvars less than a tolerance.

This action can be used to create a dynamic group of atom based on the value of a multicolvar.
In this action a multicolvar is within the dynamic group if its value is less than a target.
In actuality a weight, \f$w_i\f$ is ascribed to each colvar, \f$s_i\f$ calculated by a multicolvar
and this weight measures the degree to which a colvar is a member of the group.  This weight is a number
between 0 and 1 that is calculated using a \ref switchingfunction , \f$\sigma\f$.
If one calculates a function of the set of multicolvars
these weights are included in the calculation.  As such if one calculates the MEAN, \f$\mu\f$ of a filtered
multicolvar what is computed is the following:

\f[
\mu = \frac{ \sum_i w_i s_i }{ \sum_i w_i}
\f]

One is thus calculating the mean for those colvars that are less than the target.

\par Examples

The example shown below calculates the mean for those distances that less than 1.5 nm in length

DISTANCES GROUPA=1 GROUPB=2-50 MEAN LABEL=d1
MFILTER_LESS DATA=d1 SWITCH={GAUSSIAN D_0=1.5 R_0=0.00001} MEAN LABEL=d4
