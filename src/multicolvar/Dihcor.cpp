//+PLUMEDOC COLVAR DIHCOR
/*
Measures the degree of similarity between dihedral angles.

This colvar calculates the following quantity.

\f[
s = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \left[ 1 + \cos( \phi_i - \psi_i ) \right]
\f]

where the \f$\phi_i\f$ and \f$\psi\f$ values and the instantaneous values for the \ref TORSION angles of interest.

\par Examples

The following provides an example input for the DIHCOR action

\plumedfile
DIHCOR ...
  ATOMS1=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
  ATOMS2=5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12
  LABEL=dih
... DIHCOR
PRINT ARG=dih FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile

In the above input we are calculating the correlation between the torsion angle involving atoms 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the torsion angle
involving atoms 5, 6, 7 and 8.	This is then added to the correlation between the torsion angle involving atoms 5, 6, 7 and 8 and the
correlation angle involving atoms 9, 10, 11 and 12.

Writing out the atoms involved in all the torsion angles in this way can be rather tedious. Thankfully if you are working with protein you
can avoid this by using the \ref MOLINFO command.  PLUMED uses the pdb file that you provide to this command to learn
about the topology of the protein molecule.  This means that you can specify torsion angles using the following syntax:

\plumedfile
#SETTINGS MOLFILE=regtest/basic/rt32/helix.pdb
MOLINFO MOLTYPE=protein STRUCTURE=myprotein.pdb
dih: DIHCOR ...
ATOMS1=@phi-3,@psi-3
ATOMS2=@psi-3,@phi-4
ATOMS3=@phi-4,@psi-4
...
PRINT ARG=dih FILE=colvar STRIDE=10
\endplumedfile

Here, \@phi-3 tells plumed that you would like to calculate the \f$\phi\f$ angle in the third residue of the protein.
Similarly \@psi-4 tells plumed that you want to calculate the \f$\psi\f$ angle of the fourth residue of the protein.
