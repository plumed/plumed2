/*
Calculate distances in the plane perpendicular to an axis

Each quantity calculated in this CV uses the positions of two atoms, this indices of which are specified using the VECTORSTART and VECTOREND keywords, to specify the
orientation of a vector, $\mathbf{n}$.  The perpendicular distance between this vector and the position of some third atom is then computed using:

$$
 x_j = |\mathbf{r}_{j}| \sin (\theta_j)
$$

where $\mathbf{r}_j$ is the distance between one of the two atoms that define the vector $\mathbf{n}$ and a third atom (atom $j$) and where $\theta_j$
is the angle between the vector \f$\mathbf{n}\f$ and the vector $\mathbf{r}_{j}$.  The $x_j$ values for each of the atoms specified using the GROUP keyword are calculated.
Keywords such as MORE_THAN and LESS_THAN can then be used to calculate the number of these quantities that are more or less than a given cutoff.

The following input can be used to calculate the number of atoms that have indices greater than 3 and less than 101 that
are within a cylinder with a radius of 0.3 nm that has its long axis aligned with the vector connecting atoms 1 and 2.

```plumed
d1: INPLANEDISTANCES VECTORSTART=1 VECTOREND=2 GROUP=3-100 LESS_THAN={RATIONAL D_0=0.2 R_0=0.1}
PRINT ARG=d1.lessthan FILE=colvar
```

Notice that the INPLANEDISTANCES is a shortcut. The syntax that is described in the expanded version of the input above provides much more flexibility for designing new CVs.
