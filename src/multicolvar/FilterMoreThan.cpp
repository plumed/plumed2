//+PLUMEDOC MTRANSFORMS MTRANSFORM_MORE
/*
This action can be used to transform the colvar values calculated by a multicolvar using one minus a switching function

In this action each colvar, \f$s_i\f$, calculated by \ref mcolv is transformed by a \ref switchingfunction function that
is equal to one if the colvar is greater than a certain target value and which is equal to zero otherwise.
It is important to understand the distinction between what is done here and what is done by \ref MFILTER_MORE.
In \ref MFILTER_MORE a weight, \f$w_i\f$ for the colvar is calculated using the \ref histogrambead.  If one calculates the
MEAN for \ref MFILTER_MORE one is thus calculating:

\f[
\mu = \frac{ \sum_i [1 - \sigma(s_i) ] s_i }{\sum_i [1 - \sigma(s_i)] }
\f]

where \f$\sigma\f$ is the \ref switchingfunction.  In this action by contrast the colvar is being transformed by the \ref switchingfunction.
If one thus calculates a MEAN for this action one computes:

\f[
\mu = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N 1 - \sigma(s_i) }{ N }
\f]

In other words, you are calculating the mean for the transformed colvar.

\par Examples

The following input gives an example of how a MTRANSFORM_MORE action can be used to duplicate
functionality that is elsewhere in PLUMED.

\plumedfile
DISTANCES ...
 GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20
 LABEL=d1
... DISTANCES
MTRANSFORM_MORE DATA=d1 SWITCH={GAUSSIAN D_0=1.5 R_0=0.00001}
\endplumedfile

In this case you can achieve the same result by using:

\plumedfile
DISTANCES ...
 GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20
 MORE_THAN={GAUSSIAN D_0=1.5 R_0=0.00001}
... DISTANCES
\endplumedfile
(see \ref DISTANCES)

The advantage of MTRANSFORM_MORE comes, however, if you want to use transformed colvars as input
for \ref MULTICOLVARDENS

//+PLUMEDOC MFILTERS MFILTER_MORE
/*
This action can be used to filter the distribution of colvar values in a multicolvar so that one can compute the mean and so on for only those multicolvars more than a tolerance.

This action can be used to create a dynamic group of atom based on the value of a multicolvar.
In this action a multicolvar is within the dynamic group if its value is greater than a target.
In actuality a weight, \f$w_i\f$  is ascribed to each colvar, \f$s_i\f$ calculated by a multicolvar
and this weight measures the degree to which a colvar is a member of the group.  This weight is
calculated using a \ref switchingfunction , \f$\sigma\f$ so it is given by:

\f[
w_i = 1 - \sigma(s_i)
\f]

If one calculates a function of the set of multicolvars
these weights are included in the calculation.  As such if one calculates the MEAN, \f$\mu\f$ of a filtered
multicolvar what is computed is the following:

\f[
\mu = \frac{ \sum_i w_i s_i }{ \sum_i w_i}
\f]

One is thus calculating the mean for those colvars that are greater than the target.

\par Examples

The example shown below calculates the mean for those distances that greater than 1.5 nm in length

\plumedfile
DISTANCES GROUPA=1 GROUPB=2-50 MEAN LABEL=d1
MFILTER_MORE DATA=d1 SWITCH={GAUSSIAN D_0=1.5 R_0=0.00001} MEAN LABEL=d4
\endplumedfile

More complicated things can be done by using the label of a filter as input to a new multicolvar as shown
in the example below.  Here the coordination numbers of all atoms are computed.  The atoms with a coordination
number greater than 2 are then identified using the filter.  This reduced list of atoms is then used as input
to a second coordination number calculation.  This second coordination number thus measures the number of
two-coordinated atoms that each of the two-coordinated atoms is bound to.

\plumedfile
c1: COORDINATIONNUMBER SPECIES=1-150 SWITCH={EXP D_0=4.0 R_0=0.5 D_MAX=6.0}
cf: MFILTER_MORE DATA=c1 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=2.0 R_0=0.1} LOWMEM
c2: COORDINATIONNUMBER SPECIES=cf SWITCH={EXP D_0=4.0 R_0=0.5 D_MAX=6.0} MORE_THAN={RATIONAL D_0=2.0 R_0=0.1}
