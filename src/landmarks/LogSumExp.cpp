//+PLUMEDOC ANALYSIS LOGSUMEXP
/*
This action takes the exponential of a vector of logarithms and divides each element of the vector by the sum of the exponentials.

If you has performed a simulation with a time-independent bias, $V(x)$, you can recover the unbiased distribution from the trajectory 
by constructing a histogram in which the $i$th frame of the trajectory is given weight of:

$$
w_i = \frac{e^{\beta V(x_i)}}{\sum_j e^{\beta V(x_j)}}
$$

where $x_i$ is used to indicate the coordinates for frame $i$ and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature in units of energy.  If the bias 
is large then it is easy for $e^{\beta V(x_i)}$ to overflow.  This action thus allows you to use the following trick is to compute the $w_i$ 
values in the above expression:

$$
w_i = e^{\beta(V(x_i) - c} \qquad \textrm{where} \qquad c = \beta V_\textrm{max} + \log\left[ \sum_j e^{\beta V(x_j) - \beta V_\textrm{max}} \right]  
$$

In this expression $V_\textrm{max}$ is the maximum value the bias took during the simulation.

The following example shows how you can write a PLUMED input that exploits this trick.

```plumed
# Calculate some CVs for later analysis
t1: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
t2: TORSION ATOMS=5,6,7,8
t3: TORSION ATOMS=9,10,11,12

# This computes the bias potential 
r: RESTRAINT ARG=t1 AT=pi/2 KAPPA=10
# This calculates the instantaneous reweighting weight 
# given the bias potential that is acting upon the system
bw: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=300

# This collects our data for later analysis and the reweighting weights
cc: COLLECT_FRAMES ARG=t1,t2,t3 LOGWEIGHTS=bw

# And this determines the final vector of weights that should be used for histograms and so on.
weights: LOGSUMEXP ARG=cc_logweights 

# This outputs the time series of reweighting weights to a file
DUMPVECTOR ARG=weights FILE=weights
```
