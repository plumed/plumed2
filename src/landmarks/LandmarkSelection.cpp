Select every ith frame from the stored set of configurations

If you have collected a set of trajectory frames using [COLLECT_FRAMES](COLLECT_FRAMES.md) you can use this action to 
select a subset you have collected.  This particular method for landmark selection reduces the number of frames by selecting taking every
$i$th frame. So, for example, if you use the input below every 10th frame of the stored trajectory is transferred to the `ll_data` Value
that is output which is output in the PDB file.  This happens because we are collecting 1000 trajectory frames in total but only taking 
100 landmarks from this data.

```plumed
# This stores the positions of all the first 10 atoms in the system for later analysis
cc: COLLECT_FRAMES ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ALIGN=OPTIMAL STRIDE=1 CLEAR=1000

# Select landmarks
ll: LANDMARK_SELECT_STRIDE ARG=cc NLANDMARKS=100

# Output the data to a file 
DUMPPDB ATOMS=ll_data ATOM_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FILE=traj.pdb STRIDE=1000
```

If you expand the shortcuts in the input above you will notice that the LANDMARK_SELECT_STRIDE shortcut creates a [DISSIMILARITIES](DISSIMILARITIES.md) action 
that calculates the distances between the input frames. We need to calculate these dissimilarities here because the LANDMARK_SELECT_STRIDE shortcut computes the 
weights of the landmarks by doing a [VORONOI](VORONOI.md) analysis.  If you would like to turn this and the computing of dissimilarities off you can use the 
NODISSIMILARITIES flag.  If you do not want to compute VORONOI weights you can use the NOVORONOI flag.  Be aware, however, that dissimilarities are still computed
if you only the the NOVORONOI flag.

If you have already computed the dissimilarities between the collected frames you can pass them in input to the LANDMARK_SELECT_STRIDE funtion as shown below:

```plumed
# This stores the positions of all the first 10 atoms in the system for later analysis
cc: COLLECT_FRAMES ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ALIGN=OPTIMAL STRIDE=1 CLEAR=1000

# This calculates the dissimilarities between the stored frames
cc_dataT: TRANSPOSE ARG=cc_data
dd: DISSIMILARITIES ARG=cc_data,cc_dataT 
  
# Select landmarks 
ll: LANDMARK_SELECT_STRIDE ARG=cc DISSIMILARITIES=dd NLANDMARKS=100
    
# Output the data to a file 
DUMPPDB ATOMS=ll_data ATOM_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FILE=traj.pdb STRIDE=1000
```  

Notice that you can also read in dissimilarities from a file using a [CONSTANT](CONSTANT.md) action and pass these directly to the LANDMARK_SELECT_STRIDE action and avoid using COLLECT_FRAMES.

Select a random set of landmarks from a large set of configurations.

If you have collected a set of trajectory frames using [COLLECT_FRAMES](COLLECT_FRAMES.md) you can use this action to 
select a subset of the configurations you have collected.  This particular method for landmark selection reduces the number of frames by 
chooseing NLANDMARKS points from the data collected by COLLECT_FRAMES at random.  So, for example, if you use the input 100 randomly-selected 
points from the 1000 trajectory frames that were by collected by the COLLECT_FRAMES action are transferred to the `ll_data` Value that is output which is output in the PDB file.  

```plumed
# This stores the positions of all the first 10 atoms in the system for later analysis
cc: COLLECT_FRAMES ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ALIGN=OPTIMAL STRIDE=1 CLEAR=1000

# Select landmarks
ll: LANDMARK_SELECT_RANDOM ARG=cc NLANDMARKS=100

# Output the data to a file 
DUMPPDB ATOMS=ll_data ATOM_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FILE=traj.pdb STRIDE=1000
```

If you expand the shortcuts in the input above you will notice that the LANDMARK_SELECT_RANDOM shortcut creates a [DISSIMILARITIES](DISSIMILARITIES.md) action 
that calculates the distances between the input frames. We need to calculate these dissimilarities here because the LANDMARK_SELECT_RANDOM shortcut computes the 
weights of the landmarks by doing a [VORONOI](VORONOI.md) analysis.  If you would like to turn this and the computing of dissimilarities off you can use the 
NODISSIMILARITIES flag.  If you do not want to compute VORONOI weights you can use the NOVORONOI flag.  Be aware, however, that dissimilarities are still computed

Select a of landmarks from a large set of configurations using farthest point sampling.

If you have collected a set of trajectory frames using [COLLECT_FRAMES](COLLECT_FRAMES.md) you can use this action to 
select a subset of the configurations you have collected. This shortcut does this using [FARTHEST_POINT_SAMPLING](FARTHEST_POINT_SAMPLING.md)
the first point is thus selected at random.  The remaining points are then selected by taking the unselected point in the input data set that is the furthest
from all the points that have been selected thus far.  The following input demonstrates how you can use this method:

```plumed
# This stores the positions of all the first 10 atoms in the system for later analysis
cc: COLLECT_FRAMES ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ALIGN=OPTIMAL STRIDE=1 CLEAR=1000

# Select landmarks
ll: LANDMARK_SELECT_FPS ARG=cc NLANDMARKS=100

# Output the data to a file 
DUMPPDB ATOMS=ll_data ATOM_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FILE=traj.pdb STRIDE=1000
```

If you expand the shortcuts in the input above you will notice that the LANDMARK_SELECT_RANDOM shortcut creates a [DISSIMILARITIES](DISSIMILARITIES.md) action 
that calculates the distances between the input frames. We have to compute these dissimilarities in order to perform the farthest point sampling here so you cannot use the 
NODISSIMILARITIES flag with this action.  However, we also need the dissimilarities to compute the weights of the landmarks as this is done by performing a [VORONOI](VORONOI.md) analysis.
If you would like to turn off the computation of the VORONOI weights you can use the NOVORONOI flag.

If you have already computed the dissimilarities between the collected frames you can pass them in input to the LANDMARK_SELECT_FPS funtion as shown below:

```plumed
# This stores the positions of all the first 10 atoms in the system for later analysis
cc: COLLECT_FRAMES ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 ALIGN=OPTIMAL STRIDE=1 CLEAR=1000

# This calculates the dissimilarities between the stored frames

# Output the data to a file 
DUMPPDB ATOMS=ll_data ATOM_INDICES=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 FILE=traj.pdb STRIDE=1000
