//+PLUMEDOC MCOLVARB LWALLS
/*
Add LOWER_WALLS restraints on all the multicolvar values

This action takes the set of values calculated by the colvar specified by label in the DATA
keyword and places a restraint on each quantity, \f$x\f$, with the following functional form:

\f$
  k((x-a+o)/s)^e
\f$

\f$k\f$ (KAPPA) is an energy constant in internal unit of the code, \f$s\f$ (EPS) a rescaling factor and
\f$e\f$ (EXP) the exponent determining the power law. By default: EXP = 2, EPS = 1.0, OFF = 0.

\par Examples

The following set of commands can be used to stop any of the 800 atoms in group A from moving more than 2.46425 nm
in the z direction from atom 34137.  This is done by adding a lower wall on the z-distance between all the atoms in
group A and the position of 34137.
