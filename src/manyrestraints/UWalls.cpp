//+PLUMEDOC MCOLVARB UWALLS
/*
Add UPPER_WALL restraints on all the multicolvar values

This action takes the set of values calculated by the colvar specified by label in the DATA
keyword and places a restraint on each quantity, \f$x\f$, with the following functional form:

\f$
  k((x-a+o)/s)^e
\f$

\f$k\f$ (KAPPA) is an energy constant in internal unit of the code, \f$s\f$ (EPS) a rescaling factor and
\f$e\f$ (EXP) the exponent determining the power law. By default: EXP = 2, EPS = 1.0, OFF = 0.

\par Examples

The following set of commands can be used to stop a cluster composed of 20 atoms subliming.  The position of
the center of mass of the cluster is calculated by the \ref COM command labelled c1.  The \ref DISTANCES
command labelled d1 is then used to calculate the distance between each of the 20 atoms in the cluster
and the center of mass of the cluster.  These distances are then passed to the UWALLS command, which adds
a \ref UPPER_WALLS restraint on each of them and thereby prevents each of them from moving very far from the center
of mass of the cluster.
