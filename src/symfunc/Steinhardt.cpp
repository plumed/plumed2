Calculate 1st order Steinhardt parameters

The 1st order Steinhardt parameters allow us to measure the degree to which the first coordination shell
around an atom is ordered with the atoms aranged on a line.  The Steinhardt parameter for atom, $i$ is complex vector whose components are
calculated using the following formula:

$$
q_{1m}(i) = \sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) Y_{1m}(\mathbf{r}_{ij})
$$

where $Y_{1m}$ is one of the 1st order spherical harmonics so $m$ is a number that runs from $-1$ to
$+1$.  The function $\sigma( r_{ij} )$ is a switching function that acts on the distance between
atoms $i$ and $j$.  The parameters of this function should be set so that it the function is equal to one
when atom $j$ is in the first coordination sphere of atom $i$ and is zero otherwise.

As discussed on [this page](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/lessons/23/001/data/Steinhardt.html), the Steinhardt parameters can
be used to measure the degree of order in the system in a variety of different ways.  The
simplest way of measuring whether or not the coordination sphere is ordered is to simply take the norm of the above vector i.e.

$$
Q_1(i) = \frac{1}{\sum_j \sigma(r_{ij}) } \sqrt{ \sum_{m=-1}^1 q_{1m}(i)^{*} q_{1m}(i) }
$$

This norm is small when the coordination shell is disordered and larger when the coordination shell is ordered. The following input illustrates
how by averaging the value of this norm over all the atoms in the system you can measure the global degree of order in the system:

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2
q1_mean: MEAN ARG=q1 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=q1_mean FILE=colvar
```

In the above input the rational [switching function](LESS_THAN.md) with the parameters above. We would recommend using SWITCH syntax
rather than the syntax above when giving the parameters for the switching function as you can then use any of the switching functions described
in the documentation for [LESS_THAN](LESS_THAN.md).  More importantly, however, using this syntax allows you to set the D_MAX parameter for the
switching function as demonstrated below:

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIES=1-64 SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 D_MAX=3.0}
q1_mean: MEAN ARG=q1 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=q1_mean FILE=colvar
```

Setting the `D_MAX` can substantially improve PLUMED performance as it turns on the linked list algorithm that is discussed in the optimisation details part
of the documentation for [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md).

## Working with two types of atoms

The command below could be used to measure the Q1 parameters that describe the arrangement of chlorine ions around the
sodium atoms in sodium chloride.  The imagined system here is composed of 64 NaCl formula units and the atoms are arranged in the input
with the 64 Na$^+$ ions followed by the 64 Cl$-$ ions.  Once again the average Q1 parameter is calculated and output to a
file called colvar

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIESA=1-64 SPECIESB=65-128 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2
q1_mean: MEAN ARG=q1 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=q1_mean FILE=colvar
```

If you simply want to examine the values of the Q1 parameters for each of the atoms in your system you can do so by exploiting the
command [DUMPATOMS](DUMPATOMS.md) as shown in the example below.  The following output file will output a file in an extended xyz format
called q1.xyz for each frame of the analyzed MD trajectory.  The first column in this file will contain a dummy name for each of the
atoms, columns 2-4 will then contain the x, y and z positions of the atoms, column 5 will contain the value of the Q1 parameter, columns
6-8 will contain the real parts of the director of the $q_{1m}$ vector while columns 9-11 will contain the imaginary parts of this director.

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIESA=1-64 SPECIESB=65-128 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=q1 ARG=q1 FILE=q1.xyz
```

##Â The MASK keyword

You can use the MASK keyword with this action in the same way that it is used with [COORDINATIONNUMBER](COORDINATIONNUMBER.md).  This keyword thus expects a vector in
input, which tells Q1 that it is safe not to calculate the Q1 parameter for some of the atoms.  As illustrated below, this is useful if you are using functionality
from the [volumes module](module_volumes.md) to calculate the average value of the Q1 parameter for only those atoms that lie in a certain part of the simulation box.

```plumed
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=1-400 CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Calculate the fccubic parameter of the atoms
cc: Q1 ...
  SPECIES=1-400 MASK=sphere
  SWITCH={RATIONAL D_0=3.0 R_0=1.5 D_MAX=6.0}
...
# Multiply fccubic parameters numbers by sphere vector

# Sum of coordination numbers for atoms that are in the sphere of interest
numer: SUM ARG=prod PERIODIC=NO
# Number of atoms that are in sphere of interest
denom: SUM ARG=sphere PERIODIC=NO
# Average coordination number for atoms in sphere of interest
av: CUSTOM ARG=numer,denom FUNC=x/y PERIODIC=NO
# And print out final CV to a file
PRINT ARG=av FILE=colvar STRIDE=1
```

This input calculate the average value of the Q1 parameter for only those atoms that are within a spherical region that is centered on the point
$(2.5,2.5,2.5)$.

## Deprecated syntax

More information on the deprecated keywords that are given below is available in the documentation for the [DISTANCES](DISTANCES.md) command.
Below is an example where these deprecated keywords are used to calculate the histogram of Q1 parameters for the 64 atoms in a box of Lennard Jones print them
to a file called colvar:

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=1.0 NBINS=20 SMEAR=0.1}
PRINT ARG=q1.* FILE=colvar
```

The following example illustrates how you can use VSUM to calculate a global vector of $Q_{1m}$ values as follows:

$$
Q_{1m} = \sum_i \frac{q_{1m}(i)}{\sum_j \sigma(r_{ij})}
$$

where the sum runs over all the atoms.  You can then take these $Q_{1m}$ values and compute the following norm:

$$
s = \sqrt{ \sum_{m=-1}^1 Q_{1m}^{*} Q_{1m} }
$$

The VMEAN command that is also used in the input below performs a similar operations.  The only difference is that
we divide the sums in the first expression above by the number of atoms.

```plumed

Calculate 3rd order Steinhardt parameters.

The 3rd order Steinhardt parameters allow us to measure the degree to which the first coordination shell

$$
q_{3m}(i) = \sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) Y_{3m}(\mathbf{r}_{ij})

$$

how by averaging the value of this norm over all the atoms in the system you can measure the global degree of order in the system:

```plumed

to a file called colvar:

```plumed
q6: Q6 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=1.0 NBINS=20 SMEAR=0.1}
PRINT ARG=q6.* FILE=colvar
```

The following example illustrates how you can use VSUM to calculate a global vector of $Q_{6m}$ values as follows:

$$
Q_{6m} = \sum_i \frac{q_{6m}(i)}{\sum_j \sigma(r_{ij})}
$$

where the sum runs over all the atoms.  You can then take these $Q_{6m}$ values and compute the following norm:

$$
s = \sqrt{ \sum_{m=-6}^6 Q_{6m}^{*} Q_{6m} }
$$

The VMEAN command that is also used in the input below performs a similar operations.  The only difference is that
we divide the sums in the first expression above by the number of atoms.

```plumed
q6: Q6 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 VMEAN VSUM
PRINT ARG=q6.* FILE=colvar
```
