Calculate 1st order Steinhardt parameters

The 1st order Steinhardt parameters allow us to measure the degree to which the first coordination shell
around an atom is ordered with the atoms aranged on a line.  The Steinhardt parameter for atom, $i$ is complex vector whose components are
calculated using the following formula:

$$
q_{1m}(i) = \frac{\sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) Y_{1m}(\mathbf{r}_{ij}) }{\sum_j \sigma( r_{ij} ) }
$$

where $Y_{1m}$ is one of the 1st order spherical harmonics so $m$ is a number that runs from $-1$ to
$+1$.  The function $\sigma( r_{ij} )$ is a switching function that acts on the distance between
atoms $i$ and $j$.  The parameters of this function should be set so that it the function is equal to one
when atom $j$ is in the first coordination sphere of atom $i$ and is zero otherwise.

As discussed on [this page](https://www.plumed-tutorials.org/lessons/23/001/data/Steinhardt.html), the Steinhardt parameters can 
be used to measure the degree of order in the system in a variety of different ways.  The
simplest way of measuring whether or not the coordination sphere is ordered is to simply take the norm of the above vector i.e.

\f[
Q_1(i) = \sqrt{ \sum_{m=-1}^1 q_{1m}(i)^{*} q_{1m}(i) }
\f]

This norm is small when the coordination shell is disordered and larger when the coordination shell is ordered. Furthermore, in inputs like 
the one shown below where the keywords LESS_THAN, MIN, MAX, HISTOGRAM, MEAN and so on are used with it is the distribution of these normed quantities
that is investigated.  You can investigate precisely what calculation is performed here by expaning the shortcuts in the input below.

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN 
PRINT ARG=q1.mean FILE=colvar
```

Another similar command is provided below. This time the histogram of Q1 parameters for the 64 atoms in a box of Lennard Jones is computed and printed to
to a file called colvar:

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIES=1-64 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 HISTOGRAM={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.0 UPPER=1.0 NBINS=20 SMEAR=0.1} 
PRINT ARG=q1.* FILE=colvar
```

The command below could be used to measure the Q1 parameters that describe the arrangement of chlorine ions around the
sodium atoms in sodium chloride.  The imagined system here is composed of 64 NaCl formula units and the atoms are arranged in the input
with the 64 Na$^+$ ions followed by the 64 Cl$-$ ions.  Once again the average Q1 parameter is calculated and output to a
file called colvar

```plumed
q1: Q1 SPECIESA=1-64 SPECIESB=65-128 D_0=1.3 R_0=0.2 MEAN 
PRINT ARG=q1.mean FILE=colvar
```

If you simply want to examine the values of the Q1 parameters for each of the atoms in your system you can do so by exploiting the
command [DUMPATOMS](DUMPATOMS.xyz) as shown in the example below.  The following output file will output a file in an extended xyz format
called q1.xyz for each frame of the analyzed MD trajectory.  The first column in this file will contain a dummy name for each of the
atoms, columns 2-4 will then contain the x, y and z positions of the atoms, column 5 will contain the value of the Q1 parameter, columns
6-12 will contain the real parts of the director of the $q_{1m}$ vector while columns 12-19 will contain the imaginary parts of this director.

```plumed
