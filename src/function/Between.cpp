//+PLUMEDOC FUNCTION BETWEEN
/*
Use a switching function to determine how many of the input variables are within a certain range.

This action takes one argument, $s$ and evaluates the following function:

$$
w(s) = \int_a^b K\left( \frac{x - s}{\sigma} \right) \textrm{d}x
$$

In this equation $K$ is a symmetric function that must integrate to one and that is often
called a [kernel function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)) and $\sigma$ is a smearing parameter.
The above function can be used to evaluate whether $s$ is between $a$ and $b$. The advantage of using the function above is that
the resulting quantity has continuous derivatives. It can thus be used when calculating a collective variable upon which a simulation
bias will be applied.

The following example, shows how we can apply the function above on the instantaneous value of the distance between atom 1 and 2.
The BETWEEN action here is used to determine whether the input distance is between 0.1 and 0.2 nm.

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
b: BETWEEN ARG=d LOWER=0.1 UPPER=0.2 SMEAR=0.5
```

## The Kernel function

The $\sigma$ values in the expressions above is calculated from the parameters $a$, $b$ and $s$ that are provided using the
`LOWER`, `UPPER` and `SMEAR` parameters respectively using the following function:

$$
\sigma = s(b-a)
$$

Also note that the Kernel function $K$ that is used in the first example is a Gaussian. The actual integral that is evaluated is thus:

$$
w(s) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} \int_a^b \exp\left( -\frac{(x-s)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \textrm{d}x
$$

You can achieve the same result as the first example input by using the following input:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
b: BETWEEN ARG=d SWITCH={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.1 UPPER=0.2 SMEAR=0.5}
```

The advantage of this syntax, however, is that you can replace the Gaussian kernel in the expression can be replaced by a
triangular Kernel by changing the input to:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
b: BETWEEN ARG=d SWITCH={TRIANGULAR LOWER=0.1 UPPER=0.2 SMEAR=0.5}
```

With this input the integral is then evaluated using:

$$
w(s) = \frac{1}{2\sigma} \int_a^b 1 - H\left( \frac{x-s}{\sigma} \right) \textrm{d}x
$$

where:

$$
H(x) = \begin{cases}
x & \textrm{if} \quad x<1 \\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## Non rank zero arguments

Instead of passing a single scalar in the input to the `BETWEEN` action you can pass a single vector as shown here:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6 ATOMS4=7,8
b: BETWEEN ARG=d SWITCH={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.1 UPPER=0.2 SMEAR=0.5}
```

The input to the `BETWEEN` action here is a vector with four elements. The output from the action `b` is similarly
a vector with four elements. In calculating the elements of this vector PLUMED applies the function described in the previous
section on each of the distances in turn. The first element of `b` thus tells you if the distance between atoms 1 and 2 is between
0.1 and 0.2 nm, the second element tells you if the distance between atoms 3 and 4 is between 0.1 and 0.2 nm and so on.

You can use the commands in the above example input to evaluate the number of distances that are within the range of interest as follows:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6 ATOMS4=7,8
b: BETWEEN ARG=d SWITCH={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.1 UPPER=0.2 SMEAR=0.5}
s: SUM ARG=b PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=s FILE=colvar
```

The final scalar that is output here is evaluated using the following summation:

$$
s = \sum_i \int_a^b \left( \frac{x - d_i}{\sigma} \right) \textrm{d}x
$$

where the sum over $i$ here runs over the four distances in the above expression. This scalar tells you the number of distances that are
between 0.1 and 0.2.

Notice that you can do something similar with a matrix as input as shown below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUPA=1-10 GROUPB=11-20
b: BETWEEN ARG=d SWITCH={GAUSSIAN LOWER=0.1 UPPER=0.2 SMEAR=0.5}
s: SUM ARG=b PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=s FILE=colvar
```

This input tells PLUMED to calculate the 100 distances between the atoms in the two input groups. The final value that is printed to the colvar file then
tells you how many of these distances are between 0.1 and 0.2 nm.

## The MASK keyword

Consider the following input:

```plumed
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=1-400 CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Compute the coordination numbers
adj: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-400 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.3 D_MAX=1.0} MASK=sphere
ones: ONES SIZE=400
coord: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=adj,ones
# Determine if coordination numbers are less than 4 or not
lt: BETWEEN ARG=coord MASK=sphere SWITCH={GAUSSIAN LOWER=4.0 UPPER=6 SMEAR=0.5}
# And calculate how many atoms in the region of interst have a coordination number that is less than four
ltsphere: CUSTOM ARG=lt,sphere FUNC=x*y PERIODIC=NO
cv: SUM ARG=ltsphere PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=cv FILE=colvar
```

This input calculates the total number of atoms that are within a spherical region that is centered on the point $(2.5,2.5,2.5)$ and have a
coordination number that is between 4 and 6.  Notice that to reduce the computational expense we use the MASK keyword in the input to
[CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md) so PLUMED knows to not bother calculating the coordination numbers of atoms that are not within the spherical region of
interest. Further notice that we have also used this MASK keyword in the input to BETWEEN to prevent PLUMED from transforming the coordination numbers
that have not been calculated with the switching function to get a further speed up.

Using the MASK keyword in this way is necessary if the input argument is a vector. If the input argument is a matrix then you should never need to use the
MASK keyword. PLUMED will use the sparsity pattern for the input matrix to reduce the number of transformations that are performed within BETWEEN.
