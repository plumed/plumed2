//+PLUMEDOC FUNCTION COMBINE
/*
Calculate a polynomial combination of a set of other variables.

This action takes in $N_{arg}$ arguments ($x_i$) and computes the following function of them:

$$
C=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{arg}} c_i (x_i-a_i)^{p_i}
$$

The $c_i$, $a_i$ and $p_i$ values in this expression are provided through the COEFFICIENTS, PARAMETERS and POWERS keywords respectively.
The following example illustrates how this action can be used to calculate and print the square of the distance between atom 1 and atom 2.

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
c: COMBINE ARG=d.x,d.y,d.z COEFFICIENTS=1,1,1 PARAMETERS=0,0,0 POWERS=2,2,2 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

Notice that if the COEFFICIENTS keyword is absent all the $c_i$ values are set equal to 1.
Furthermore, if the PARAMETERS keyword is absent all the $a_i$ values are set equal to 0.
We can thus make use of these defaults and rewrite the input above as:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
c: COMBINE ARG=d.x,d.y,d.z POWERS=2,2,2 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

Notice that we cannot remove the POWERS keyword here as if it is absent all the $p_i$ values are set equal to 1.

## The NORMALIZE flag

Using the NORAMALIZE flag in the input below ensures that the coefficients of the three input scalars are all set equal to one:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
c: COMBINE ARG=d.x,d.y,d.z NORMALIZE PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

Notice that you can use this flag together with the coefficient keyword as shown below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2 COMPONENTS
c: COMBINE ARG=d.x,d.y,d.z NORMALIZE COEFFICIENTS=2,1,3 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

The coefficients of `d.x`, `d.y` and `d.z` for this input are 1/3, 1/6 and 1/2 respectively.


## Periodic arguments

The COMBINE action is not able to predict the periodic domain for the function that is computed from the arguments
automatically.  The user is thus forced to specify it explicitly. Use PERIODIC=NO if the resulting variable is not periodic,
and PERIODIC=A,B where A and B are the two boundaries for the periodic domain if the resulting variable is periodic.
The following provides an example where the output from combine has a periodic domain.  In this input we are taking the
cube of a dihedral angle.  The dihedral angle has a periodic domain that runs from $-\pi$ to $\pi$.  The cube of this variable
thus has a periodic domain that runs from $-\pi^3$ to $\pi^3$ as indicated in the following input.

```plumed
t: TORSION ATOMS=1,3,5,7
#c: COMBINE ARG=t POWERS=3 PERIODIC=-31.0062766802998,31.0062766802998
c: COMBINE ARG=t POWERS=3 PERIODIC=-pi^3,pi^3
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

## Vector arguments

The two examples in the previous section demonstrate how to use the COMBINE action with scalar arguments.  However, you can also
pass arguments to this action that have a rank greater than zero.  For example, in the example below COMBINE accepts three
vectors with 4 elements in input:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6 ATOMS4=7,8 COMPONENTS
c: COMBINE ARG=d.x,d.y,d.z POWERS=2,2,2 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

The output from the COMBINE action here is also a vector with four elements. The first element of this vector is the square of the
distance betwen atoms 1 and 2, the second is the square of the distance between atoms 3 and 4 and so on.

The COMBINE action can also take a mixture of scalars and vectors in input as long as the labels of vectors appear before the labels of scalars
in the input to the ARG keyword.  The following input illustrates an COMBINE action that takes vectors and scalars in input.

```plumed
p: CONSTANT VALUE=2
d: DISTANCE ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6 ATOMS4=7,8
c: COMBINE ARG=d,p COEFFICIENTS=4,-1 POWERS=2.5,1 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

The elements of the vector that is calculated by the COMBINE action here are given by:

$$
c_i = 4d_i^{2.5} - 2
$$

The $d_i$ in this expression are the distances that were calculated by the DISTANCE action. The 2 comes
from the scalar `p` that passed to the ARG action in input.  As a single scalar is passed the same number is
used when calculating all 4 elements of the output vector.  In other words, the scalar behaves as if it is a
vector with four components that all have the same value.

Lastly, notice that if you pass a single vector in input to COMBINE as in the following example, the output is still a vector:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE ATOMS1=1,2 ATOMS2=3,4 ATOMS3=5,6 ATOMS4=7,8
c: COMBINE ARG=d COEFFICIENTS=4 POWERS=2.5 PARAMETERS=0.5 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

To calculate the 4-dimensional output by the COMBINE action here we subtract 0.5 from each of the input distances, raise
the result from this subtraction to the power 2.5 and then multiply the result by 4.

If you want to calculate a linear combination of the elements of a vector using the formula at the top of the page you should use
the [CUSTOM](CUSTOM.md) action to transform all the components of the input vector.  You can then add all the results from these
transformations together using [SUM](SUM.md).

## Matrix arguments

You can also use matrices in the input to the COMBINE action as illustrated below:

```plumed
d: DISTANCE_MATRIX GROUPA=1,2 GROUPB=3,4,5 COMPONENTS
c: COMBINE ARG=d.x,d.y,d.z POWERS=2,2,2 PERIODIC=NO
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

The input to the combine action here consists of three $2\times3$ matrices. The output is thus a $2\times3$ matrix that contains the squares of the
distances between the atoms in GROUPA and the atoms in GROUPB.  Notice that all the input matrices must have the same size as the elements of the final
matrix are calculated by applying the formula in the first section of this input to each set of elements to the input matrices in turn.

The input to this action can be a combination of matrices and scalars as long as the labels of the matrices appear before the labels of the scalars in the input for the ARG keyword.
If your input arguments are an $N\times M$ matrix and a scalar the scalar is treated as if
it is a $N\times M$ matrix which has all its elements equal to the input scalar. You __cannot__ use a mixture of vectors and matrices in the input to this action.

Furthermore, if you pass a single matrix to COMBINE the output is a matrix.  To calculate a linear combination of all the elements in a matrix using the formula at the top of the page you should use
the [CUSTOM](CUSTOM.md) action to transform all the components of the input vector.  You can then add all the results from these transformations together using [SUM](SUM.md).

## The MASK keyword

The example input below illustrates a way you can use the MASK keyword to improve PLUMED performance for inputs that use COMBINE actions that take arguments that
are vectors:

```plumed
# Fixed virtual atom which serves as the probe volume's center (pos. in nm)
center: FIXEDATOM AT=2.5,2.5,2.5
ow: GROUP ATOMS=1-400
hw: GROUP ATOMS=401-1200
# Vector in which element i is one if atom i is in sphere of interest and zero otherwise
sphere: INSPHERE ATOMS=ow CENTER=center RADIUS={GAUSSIAN D_0=0.5 R_0=0.01 D_MAX=0.52}
# Calculate coordination with oxygen atoms
ow_ones: ONES SIZE=400
ow_mat: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=ow MASK=sphere SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.3 D_MAX=0.8}
ow_coord: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=ow_mat,ow_ones
# Calculate the coordination with hydrogen atoms
hw_ones: ONES SIZE=800
hw_mat: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUPA=ow GROUPB=hw MASK=sphere SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.1 D_MAX=0.5}
hw_coord: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=hw_mat,hw_ones
# And do the linear combination of the transformed coordination numbers together
prod: COMBINE ARG=hw_coord,ow_coord COEFFICIENTS=2,8 MASK=sphere PERIODIC=NO
# Sum of coordination numbers for atoms that are in the sphere of interest
numer: SUM ARG=prod PERIODIC=NO
denom: SUM ARG=sphere PERIODIC=NO
cv: CUSTOM ARG=numer,denom FUNC=x/y PERIODIC=NO
# And print out final CV to a file
PRINT ARG=cv FILE=colvar STRIDE=1
```

The variable being computed is computed for the oxygen atoms in a spherical region centered on the point $(2.5,2.5,2.5)$ and is a linear combination of
the coordination number of the atoms in this region with the oxygen atoms and the coordination number of the atoms in this region with the hydrogen atoms.
The average value of this linear combination for the atoms that are within this region is output.

If the arguments input to the COMBINE action are matrices then the MASK keyword is used in the way that is described in the documentation for the [CUSTOM](CUSTOM.md).
