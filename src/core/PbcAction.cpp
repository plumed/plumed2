//+PLUMEDOC ANALYSIS PBC
/*
Pass the cell vectors into PLUMED.

This command is used to pass the cell vectors from an MD code to PLUMED. The command is a specialised
version of the [PUT](PUT.md) command that accepts a $3\times 3$ matrix.  The additional specialisation is
required because the cell vectors play a special role when you do calculations with PLUMED.

Notice that when you create a [DOMAIN_DECOMPOSITION](DOMAIN_DECOMPOSITION.md) action a PBC action is created
automatically.

You would only use the PBC command if you were calling PLUMED from python or an MD code. There is no reason for using this command in a conventional PLUMED
input file like this:

```plumed
pbc: PBC
```

Instead this command would be called from python like this:

```python
import plumed

# Create a PLUMED object
p = plumed.Plumed()
p.cmd("readInputLine", "pbc: PBC")
```
