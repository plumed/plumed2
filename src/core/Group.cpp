//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC GROUP
/*
Define a group of atoms so that a particular list of atoms can be referenced with a single label in definitions of CVs or virtual atoms.

The GROUP command can be used to define a list of atoms so that the group can be referenced in the definitions of other
CVs or virtual atoms as shown below:

```plumed
o: GROUP ATOMS=1,4,7,11,14
h: GROUP ATOMS=2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13
# compute the coordination among the two groups
c: COORDINATION GROUPA=o GROUPB=h R_0=0.3
# same could have been obtained without GROUP, just writing:
# c: COORDINATION GROUPA=1,4,7,11,14 GROUPB=2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13

# print the coordination on file 'colvar'
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

The first group command here creates a group of atoms called `o` containing atoms 1, 4, 7, 11 and 14.
The second group command here creates a group of toms called `h` containing atoms 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13.

As discussed on [this page](specifying_atoms.md) atoms in groups can be listed as comma separated numbers (i.e. `1,2,3,10,45,7,9`),
simple positive ranges (i.e. `20-40`), ranges with a stride either positive or negative (i.e. `20-40:2` or `80-50:-2`) or as
comma separated combinations of all the former methods (`1,2,4,5,10-20,21-40:2,80-50:-2`).

Oftentime people will store the definitions in a separate file as has been done in the following example input.

```plumed
INCLUDE FILE=extras/groups.dat
# compute the coordination among the two groups
c: COORDINATION GROUPA=groupa GROUPB=groupb R_0=0.3
# print the coordination on file 'colvar'
PRINT ARG=c FILE=colvar
```

Storing the groups in the extra file is particularly useful if the groups include list of thousand atoms. Putting these definitions
in a separate file ensures that the main plumed.dat file is not cluttered.  You can even use a [GROMACS index file](https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/ndx.html)
to hold the groups as illustrated in the input below:

```plumed
# import group named 'Protein' from file index.ndx
pro: GROUP NDX_FILE=extras/index.ndx NDX_GROUP=Protein
# dump all the atoms of the protein on a trajectory file
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=pro FILE=traj.gro
```

Notice that you use the keyword `NDX_FILE` to set the name of the index file and `NDX_GROUP` to set the name of the group to be imported (default is first one).
Further notice that starting from version 2.10 it is possible to directly use an `@ndx:` selector in the input to an action as shwn below:

```plumed
DUMPATOMS ATOMS={@ndx:{extras/index.ndx Protein}} FILE=traj.gro
```

Lastly notice that it is also possible to remove atoms from the list of atoms specified in a GROUP by using the keywords `REMOVE`, `SORT`, and `UNIQUE` as shown below:

```plumed
# take one atom every three, that is oxygens
ox: GROUP ATOMS=1-90:3
# take the remaining atoms, that is hydrogens
hy: GROUP ATOMS=1-90 REMOVE=ox
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=ox FILE=ox.gro
DUMPATOMS ATOMS=hy FILE=hy.gro
```

When you used the GROUP command the flow as follows:

- If `ATOMS` is present, then take the ordered list of atoms from the `ATOMS` keyword as a starting list.
- Alternatively, if `NDX_FILE` is present, use the list obtained from the gromacs group.
- If `REMOVE` is present, then remove the first occurrence of each of these atoms from the list.
  If one tries to remove an atom that was not listed plumed adds a notice in the output.
  An atom that is present twice in the original list might be removed twice.
- If `SORT` is present, then the resulting list is sorted by increasing serial number.
- If `UNIQUE` is present, then the resulting list is sorted by increasing serial number _and_ duplicate elements are removed.

Notice that this command just creates a shortcut, and does not imply any real calculation.
So, having a huge group defined does not slow down your calculation in any way.
It is just convenient to better organize input files.
