Calculate the ensemble average of a collective variable

The ensemble average for a non-periodic, collective variable, \f$s\f$ is given by the following expression:

\f[
\langle s \rangle = \frac{ \sum_{t'=0}^t w(t') s(t') }{ \sum_{t'=0}^t w(t') }
\f]

Here the sum runs over a the trajectory and \f$s(t')\f$ is used to denote the value of the collective variable
at time \f$t'\f$.  The final quantity evaluated is a weighted
average as the weights, \f$w(t')\f$, allow us to negate the effect any bias might have on the region of phase space
sampled by the system.  This is discussed in the section of the manual on \ref Analysis.

When the variable is periodic (e.g. \ref TORSION) and has a value, \f$s\f$, in \f$a \le s \le b\f$ the ensemble average is evaluated using:

\f[
\langle s \rangle = a + \frac{b - a}{2\pi} \arctan \left[ \frac{ \sum_{t'=0}^t w(t') \sin\left( \frac{2\pi [s(t')-a]}{b - a} \right) }{ \sum_{t'=0}^t w(t') \cos\left( \frac{2\pi [s(t')-a]}{b - a} \right) } \right]
\f]

\par Examples

The following example calculates the ensemble average for the distance between atoms 1 and 2
and output this to a file called COLVAR.  In this example it is assumed that no bias is acting
on the system and that the weights, \f$w(t')\f$ in the formulas above can thus all be set equal
to one.

\plumedfile
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
d1a: AVERAGE ARG=d1
PRINT ARG=d1a FILE=colvar STRIDE=100
\endplumedfile

The following example calculates the ensemble average for the torsional angle involving atoms 1, 2, 3 and 4.
At variance with the previous example this quantity is periodic so the second formula in the above introduction
is used to calculate the average.  Furthermore, by using the CLEAR keyword we have specified that block averages
are to be calculated.  Consequently, after 100 steps all the information acquired thus far in the simulation is
forgotten and the process of averaging is begun again.  The quantities output in the colvar file are thus the
block averages taken over the first 100 frames of the trajectory, the block average over the second 100 frames
of trajectory and so on.

\plumedfile
t1: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
t1a: AVERAGE ARG=t1 CLEAR=100
PRINT ARG=t1a FILE=colvar STRIDE=100
\endplumedfile

This third example incorporates a bias.  Notice that the effect the bias has on the ensemble average is removed by taking
advantage of the \ref REWEIGHT_BIAS method.  The final ensemble averages output to the file are thus block ensemble averages for the
unbiased canonical ensemble at a temperature of 300 K.

\plumedfile
t1: TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
RESTRAINT ARG=t1 AT=pi KAPPA=100.
ww: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=300
t1a: AVERAGE ARG=t1 LOGWEIGHTS=ww CLEAR=100
PRINT ARG=t1a FILE=colvar STRIDE=100
