//+PLUMEDOC REWEIGHTING WHAM_HISTOGRAM
/*
This can be used to output the a histogram using the weighted histogram technique

This shortcut action allows you to calculate a histogram using the weighted histogram
analysis technique.  For more detail on how this the weights for configurations are
computed see \ref REWEIGHT_WHAM

\par Examples

The following input can be used to analyze the output from a series of umbrella sampling calculations.
The trajectory from each of the simulations run with the different biases should be concatenated into a
single trajectory before running the following analysis script on the concatenated trajectory using PLUMED
driver.  The umbrella sampling simulations that will be analyzed using the script below applied a harmonic
restraint that restrained the torsional angle involving atoms 5, 7, 9 and 15 to particular values.  The script
below calculates the reweighting weights for each of the trajectories and then applies the binless WHAM algorithm
to determine a weight for each configuration in the concatenated trajectory.  A histogram is then constructed from
the configurations visited and their weights.  This histogram is then converted into a free energy surface and output
to a file called fes.dat
