//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC LOAD
/*
Loads a library, possibly defining new actions.

The LOAD action is only available on systems that allow dynamic loading.
This action allows you load new funcionality into PLUMED at runtime.
This new functionality can be in a .so file or a .cpp file. If the 
new functionality is in a cpp file then the code is compiled and the
the resulting object is loaded.

Using the LOAD action is useful for making quick tests while developing your own
actions. Of course, once your implementation is ready you should 
add it to the PLUMED source tree and recompile PLUMED.

One way to use the LOAD action is to directly load a cpp file as illustrated in the input below.

```plumed
#SETTINGS INPUTFILES=regtest/basic/rt15/Distance2.cpp
# load the new definition
# this is a cpp file so it will be compiled
LOAD FILE=regtest/basic/rt15/Distance2.cpp
# compute standard distance
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
# compute modified distance
d2: DISTANCE2 ATOMS=1,10
# print them on a file
PRINT ARG=d,d2 FILE=compare-them
```

When PLUMED reads the input above it first compiles the code in `Distance2.cpp`. The resulting object file
is then loaded into PLUMED. If you look at the cpp file that is input in the command above you can see that 
a new action called `DISTANCE2` is defined within it.  We can thus use this new action in the input above.

Instead of compiling the code at runtime you can construct a shared object from the Distance2.cpp file and LOAD the shared library instead of 
the cpp file.  To construct the shared object you would use the following command:

````
> plumed mklib Distance2.cpp
```` 

When you run this command a new file called `Distance2.so` (or `Distance2.dylib` on a mac) is created.
You can then load this shared object in PLUMED by using the following LOAD command

````
LOAD FILE=Distance2.so
````

The new functionality within the Distance2.cpp file can then be used in the remainder of the input in the same way it was 
used in the previous example.
(Notice that the only reason for not using the usual PLUMED syntax highlightling in the example above is that we have no 
file called Distance2.so.)

From PLUMED 2.10 onwards the LOAD action can be placed at any point of the input
file. The loaded functionality will then only affect commands that are placed after the LOAD action.
These features are illustrated in the input below:

```plumed
#SETTINGS INPUTFILES=regtest/basic/rt15/Distance3.cpp
# compute standard distance
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
# load the new definition
LOAD FILE=regtest/basic/rt15/Distance3.cpp
# compute modified distance
d2: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
# print them on a file
PRINT ARG=d,d2 FILE=compare-them
```

Notice that the `Distance3.cpp` uses the command:

```c++
PLUMED_REGISTER_ACTION(Distance,"DISTANCE")
```

Instead of the command:

```c++
PLUMED_REGISTER_ACTION(Distance,"DISTANCE2")
```

that was used in `Distance2.cpp`. Consequently, when we load the `Distance3.cpp` file here we redefine the DISTANCE command.
The functions that compute `d` and `d2` in the above input are thus different.

A final point to note is that, starting with PLUMED 2.10, the LOAD action can be used in contexts where
multiple Plumed objects exist. A possible example is multithreading: loading an action
from a Plumed object used in one thread will not affect other threads.
Another example is if multiple Plumed objects are created in the C/C++ or Python interface.
If a LOAD command is used in one of these objects, the loaded action will not affect
the other objects.

> [!NOTE]
> The example inputs on this page appear as not working because you cannot use the dynamic loading on GitHub Actions. On a machine where this functionality is available these inputs should work.
