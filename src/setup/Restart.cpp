//+PLUMEDOC GENERIC RESTART
/*
Activate restart.

This is a Setup directive and, as such, should appear
at the beginning of the input file. It influences the way
PLUMED treat files open for writing (see also \ref Files).

Notice that it is also possible to enable or disable restart on a per-action
basis using the RESTART keyword on a single action. In this case,
the keyword should be assigned a value. RESTART=AUTO means that global
settings are used, RESTART=YES or RESTART=NO respectively enable
and disable restart for that single action.

\attention
This directive can have also other side effects, e.g. on \ref METAD
and \ref PBMETAD and on some analysis action.

\par Examples

Using the following input:
\plumedfile
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=out
\endplumedfile
a new 'out' file will be created. If an old one is on the way, it will be automatically backed up.

On the other hand, using the following input:
\plumedfile
RESTART
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d FILE=out
\endplumedfile
the file 'out' will be appended.

In the following case, file out1 will be backed up and file out2 will be concatenated
\plumedfile
RESTART
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
d2: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d1 FILE=out1 RESTART=NO
PRINT ARG=d2 FILE=out2
\endplumedfile

In the following case, file out will backed up even if the MD code thinks that we
are restarting. Notice that not all the MD code send to PLUMED information about restarts.
If you are not sure, always put `RESTART` when you are restarting and nothing when you aren't
\plumedfile
RESTART NO
d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,2
PRINT ARG=d1 FILE=out1
\endplumedfile
