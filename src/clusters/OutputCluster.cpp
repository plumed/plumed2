//+PLUMEDOC CONCOMP OUTPUT_CLUSTER
/*
Output the indices of the atoms in one of the clusters identified by a clustering object

This action provides one way of getting output from a [DFSCLUSTERING](DFSCLUSTERING.md) calculation.
The output in question here is a [gromacs ndx file](https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.6/online/ndx.html)
that contains a list of the atom indices
that form part of one of the clusters that was identified using DFSCLUSTERING

The input shown below constructs a [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md) that describes the connectivity between the atoms.
The DFS algorithm is then used to find the connected components
in this matrix.  The indices of the atoms in the largest connected component are then output
to a ndx file.

```plumed
mat: CONTACT_MATRIX ATOMS=1-1996 SWITCH={CUBIC D_0=0.34 D_MAX=0.38}
dfs: DFSCLUSTERING ARG=mat
OUTPUT_CLUSTER ATOMS=1-1996 CLUSTERS=dfs CLUSTER=1 FILE=dfs.ndx
```
