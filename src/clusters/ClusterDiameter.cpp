//+PLUMEDOC CONCOMP CLUSTER_DIAMETER
/*
Print out the diameter of one of the connected components.

An example input that determines the diameter of the second largest cluster that is identified by
analysing the connected components of a [CONTACT_MATRIX](CONTACT_MATRIX.md) using [DFSCLUSTERING](DFSCLUSTERING.md) is shown below:

```plumed
# Calculate a contact matrix between the first 100 atoms in the configuration
cm: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-100 SWITCH={CUBIC D_0=0.45  D_MAX=0.55}
# Find the connected components from the contact matrix
dfs: DFSCLUSTERING ARG=cm
# Returns a 100-dimensional vector that is 1 if the correpsonding atom index is in the largest cluster and is zero otherwise
clust: CLUSTER_WEIGHTS CLUSTERS=dfs CLUSTER=1
# And determine the size of the largest cluster that was identified
c1: CLUSTER_DIAMETER ARG=clust ATOMS=1-100
PRINT ARG=c1 FILE=colvar
```

The diameter here is defined as the largest of all the distances between the pairs of atom in the cluster

__The output from this action is NOT differentiable__
