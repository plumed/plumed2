Determine the atoms that are within a certain cutoff of the atoms in a cluster.

This shortcut action can be used to identify the atoms within the largest connected cluster in a system as well
as the atoms around the cluster as shown in the example input below:

```plumed
# Calculate a matrix with elements that are non zero if the corresponding atoms are within 0.38 of each other
cmat: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-1996 SWITCH={CUBIC D_0=0.34 D_MAX=0.38}
# Calculate the coordination numbers of all the atoms
ones: ONES SIZE=1996
c1: MATRIX_VECTOR_PRODUCT ARG=cmat,ones
# Now identify those atoms that have a coordination number that is less than 13.5
cf: LESS_THAN ARG=c1 SWITCH={CUBIC D_0=13 D_MAX=13.5}

# Now construct an adjacency matrix with elements that are equal to one if atoms are within 0.38 of each other
# and if they both have a coordination number that is less than 13.5
cmat2: CONTACT_MATRIX GROUP=1-1996 SWITCH={CUBIC D_0=0.34 D_MAX=0.38}
dmat: OUTER_PRODUCT ARG=cf,cf
mat: CUSTOM ARG=cmat2,dmat FUNC=x*y PERIODIC=NO
# Find the connected componets of this matrix
dfs: DFSCLUSTERING ARG=mat

# Now identify the atoms that are within the largest cluster and the atoms that are within 0.38 nm of the
#Â atoms that are within this cluster.  Determine how many atoms in total satisfy this condition and the
# distance betwen the two atoms in this set that are farthest appart.
clust2a: CLUSTER_WITHSURFACE ATOMS=1-1996 CLUSTERS=dfs CLUSTER=1 RCUT_SURF={CUBIC D_0=0.34 D_MAX=0.38}
size2a: SUM ARG=clust2a PERIODIC=NO
dia2a: CLUSTER_DIAMETER ATOMS=1-1996 ARG=clust2a
PRINT ARG=size2a,dia2a
```
