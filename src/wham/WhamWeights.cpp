//+PLUMEDOC REWEIGHTING WHAM_WEIGHTS
/*
Calculate and output weights for configurations using the weighted histogram analysis method.

This shortcut action allows you to calculate and output weights computed using the weighted histogram
analysis technique.  For more detail on how this technique works see \ref REWEIGHT_WHAM

\par Examples

The following input can be used to analyze the output from a series of umbrella sampling calculations.
The trajectory from each of the simulations run with the different biases should be concatenated into a
single trajectory before running the following analysis script on the concatenated trajectory using PLUMED
driver.  The umbrella sampling simulations that will be analyzed using the script below applied a harmonic
restraint that restrained the torsional angle involving atoms 5, 7, 9 and 15 to particular values.  The script
below calculates the reweighting weights for each of the trajectories and then applies the binless WHAM algorithm
to determine a weight for each configuration in the concatenated trajectory.
