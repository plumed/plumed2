\page Installation Installation

In this page you can learn how to
\link ConfiguringPlumed configure\endlink,
\link CompilingPlumed compile\endlink,
and \link InstallingPlumed install\endlink
PLUMED.
For those of you who are impatient, the following might do the job:
\verbatim
> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
> make -j 4
> make doc # this is optional and requires doxygen installed
> make install # this is also optional - plumed can be used from the compilation directory
\endverbatim

Once the above is completed you can use PLUMED to analyze
existing trajectories or you can play with the Lennard-Jones code that is included.
However, because PLUMED is mostly used to bias on the fly simulations
performed with serious molecular dynamics packages, 
you can find instructions about how to
\link Patching patch \endlink
your favorite MD code so that it can be combined with PLUMED below.
Again, if you are impatient, something like this will do the job:
\verbatim
> source /plumed/root/dir/sourceme.sh
> cd /md/root/dir
> plumed patch -p
\endverbatim
Then compile your MD code.
For some MD codes these instructions are insufficient.
It is thus recommended that you read the instructions
at the end of this page.
Notice that MD codes could in principle be "PLUMED ready"
in their official distribution. If your favorite MD code is available "PLUMED ready" 
you will have to compile PLUMED first as a library then check the MD codes' manual to
discover how to link it.

\section ConfiguringPlumed Configuring PLUMED

The "./configure" command 
just generates a Makefile.conf file and a sourceme.sh file.
In PLUMED 2.0 these files were pre-prepared and stored in the 
directory configurations/. The new ones generated by ./configure
should be compatible with the old ones. In other words, if you have difficulties  
with the new procedure, you can use one of these old configuration files. However,
it should be easy to enforce a similar setup on autoconf by passing
the proper arguments on the command line. We strongly encourage you to configure
plumed in this way.  If you have problems on your architecture, please
report them to the mailing list.

Useful command line options for ./configure can be found by typing
\verbatim
> ./configure --help
\endverbatim
Notice that some functionalities of PLUMED depend on external
libraries which are looked for by configure. You can typically
avoid looking for a library using the "disable" syntax, e.g.
\verbatim
> ./configure --disable-mpi --disable-matheval
\endverbatim

Notice that when mpi search is enabled (by default) compilers
such as "mpic++" and "mpicxx" are searched for first. On the other hand,
if mpi search is disabled ("./configure --disable-mpi") non-mpi
compilers are searched for. Notice that only a few of the
possible compiler name are searched. Thus, compilers such as
"g++-mp-4.8" should be explicitly requested with the CXX option.

You can better control which compiler is used by setting the
variables CXX and CC. E.g., to use Intel compilers use the following command:
\verbatim
> ./configure CXX=icpc CC=icc
\endverbatim
Notice that we are using icpc in this example, which is not an mpi compiler as a 
result mpi will not be enabled.

To tune the compilation options you can use the CXXFLAGS variable:
\verbatim
> ./configure CXXFLAGS=-O3
\endverbatim

If you are implementing new functionality and want to build with debug flags 
in place so as to do some checking you can use
\verbatim
> ./configure --enable-debug
\endverbatim
This will perform some extra check during execution (possibly slowing down PLUMED)
and write full symbol tables in the executable (making the final executable  much larger).

The main goal of the automatic configure is to find the libraries.
When they are stored in unconventional places it is thus sensible to tell autoconf where 
to look! To do this there are some environment variable that can be used to instruct the linker
which directories it should search for libraries inside. These variables are compiler dependent,
but could have been set by the system administrator so that libraries are found
without any extra flag. Our suggested procedure is to 
first try to configure without any additional flags and to then check the log so as to see whether
or not the libraries were properly detected.

If a library is not found during configuration, you can try to use options to modify the
seatch path.
For example if your matheval libraries is in /opt/local (this is where MacPorts put it)
use
\verbatim
> ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
\endverbatim
Notice that PLUMED will first try to link a routine from say matheval
without any additional flag, and then in case of failure will retry adding
"-lmatheval" to the LIBS options. This allows you to use libraries
with custom names. So, if
your matheval library is called /opt/local/lib/libmymatheval.so you can 
link it with
\verbatim
> ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LIBS=-lmymatheval
\endverbatim
In this example, if the linker finds the libmymatheval.so library it will be happy.
If not it will try adding "-lmatheval". If also this does not work, the matheval library will be
disabled and some features will not be available.
This rule is true for all the libraries, so that you will always be able to link
a specific version of a library by specifying it using the LIBS variable.

\warning On Linux you might have problems using the LDFLAGS option. In particular,
if you have problems in linking the file 'src/lib/plumed-shared', try to set correctly
the runtime path by using
\verbatim
> ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/opt/local/lib" \
  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LIBS=-lmymatheval
\endverbatim
Notice that although the file 'src/lib/plumed-shared' is not necessary, being
able to produce it means that it will be possible to link PLUMED dynamically
with MD codes later.

PLUMED needs blas and lapack. These are treated slighty different from
other libraries. The search is done in the usual way (i.e., first
look for them without any link flag, then add "-lblas" and "-llapack", resepctively).
As such  if you want to use a specific version of blas or lapack
you can make them available to configure by using
\verbatim
> ./configure LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/blas/lib LIBS=-lnameoflib
\endverbatim
If the functions of these libraries are not found, the compiler
looks for a version with a final underscore added.
Finally, since blas and lapack are compulsory in PLUMED,
you can use a internal version of these libraries that comes as part of PLUMED.
If all else fails the internal version of BLAS and LAPACK are the ones that will be
used by PLUMED.
If you wish to disable any search for external libraries
(e.g. because the system libraries have problems) this can be done with
\verbatim
> ./configure --disable-external-lapack
\endverbatim

As a final resort, you can also edit the resulting Makefile.conf file.
Notable variables in this file include:
- DYNAMIC_LIB : these are the libraries needed to compile the PLUMED
library (e.g. -L/path/to/matheval -lmatheval etc). Notice that for the
PLUMED shared library to be compiled properly these should be dynamic
libraries. Also notice that PLUMED preferentially requires BLAS and LAPACK library;
see \ref BlasAndLapack for further info. Notice that the variables 
that you supply with `configure LIBS=something` will end up in this
variable. This is a bit misleading but is required to keep the configuration
files compatible with PLUMED 2.0.
- LIBS : these are the libraries needed when patching an MD code; typically only "-ldl" (needed to have functions for dynamic loading).
- CPPFLAGS : add here definition needed to enable specific optional functions;
e.g. use -D__PLUMED_HAS_MATHEVAL to enable the matheval library
- SOEXT : this gives the extension for shared libraries in your system, typically
"so" on unix, "dylib" on mac; If your system does not support dynamic libraries or, for some other reason, you would like only static executables you can
just set this variable to a blank ("SOEXT=").

\subsection BlasAndLapack BLAS and LAPACK

We tried to keep PLUMED as independent as possible from external libraries and as such those features
that require external libraries (e.g. Almost and Matheval) are optional. However, to have a properly working version
of plumed PLUMED you need BLAS and LAPACK libraries.  We would strongly recommend you download these libraries and 
install them separately so as to have the most efficient possible implementations of the functions contained within 
them.  However, if you cannot install blas and lapack, you can use the internal ones.
Since version 2.1, PLUMED uses a configure script to detect libraries. In case system LAPACK or BLAS
are not found on your system, PLUMED will use the internal replacement.

We have had a number of emails (and have struggled ourselves) with ensuring that PLUMED 
can link BLAS and LAPACK.  The following describes some of the pitfalls that you can fall
into and a set of sensible steps by which you can check whether or not you have set up the configuration
correctly.

Notice first of all that the DYNAMIC_LIB variable in the Makefile.conf
should contain the flag necessary to load the BLAS and LAPACK libraries.  Typically this will be
-llapack -lblas, in some case followed by -lgfortran.  Full path specification with -L may be necessary 
and on some machines the blas and lapack libraries may not be called -llapack and -lblas.
Everything will depend on your system configuration.

Some simple to fix further problems include:
- If the linker complains and suggests recompiling lapack with -fPIC, it means that you have static lapack libraries. Either install dynamic lapack libraries
or switch to static compilation of PLUMED by unsetting the SOEXT variable
in the configuration file.
- If the linker complains about other missing functions (typically starting with
  "for_" prefix) then you should also link some Fortran libraries. PLUMED
  is written in C++ and often C++ linkers do not include Fortran libraries by default.
  These libraries are required for lapack and blas to work. Please check the documentation of your compiler.
- If the linker complains that dsyevr_ cannot be found, try adding
  -DF77_NO_UNDERSCORE to CPPFLAGS
  Notice that "./configure" should automatically try this solution.

\section CompilingPlumed Compiling PLUMED

Once configured, PLUMED can be compiled using the following command:
\verbatim
> make -j 4
\endverbatim
This will compile the entire code and produce a number of files
in the 'src/lib' directory, including the executable 
'src/lib/plumed'. When shared libraries are enabled,
a shared libraries called 'src/lib/libKernel.so' should also have been compiled. 
Notice that the extension could be '.dylib' on a Mac.

The file 'sourceme.sh' that has been created by
the configure script in the main PLUMED directory
can be "sourced" (presently only working for bash shell)
if you want to use PLUMED *without installing it* (i.e. from the compilation
directory). It is a good idea to source it:
\verbatim
> source sourceme.sh
\endverbatim

If compilation is successful, 
a "plumed" executable should be in your path. Try to type
\verbatim
> plumed -h
\endverbatim

\warning If you are cross compiling, the plumed executable
will not work. As a consequence, you won't be able to run regtests
or compile the manual.

You can also check if PLUMED is correctly compiled by performing our regression tests.
Be warned that some of them fail because of the different numerical accuracy on different machines.
\verbatim
> cd regtest
> make
\endverbatim 
Notice that regtests are performed using the "plumed" executable that is currenty in the path.
You can check the exact version they will use by using the command
\verbatim
> which plumed
\endverbatim
This means that if you do not source "sourceme.sh", the tests will fails. This does not mean 
that plumed is not working it just means that you haven't told them shell where to find plumed!

Notice that the compiled executable, which now sits in 'src/lib/plumed', relies
on other resource files present in the compilation directory.
This directory should thus stay in the correct place. One should thus not
rename or delete it. In fact the path to the PLUMED root directory is 
hardcoded in the plumed executable as can be verified using 
\verbatim
> plumed info --root
\endverbatim
In case you try to use the plumed executable without the compilation
directory in place (e.g. you move away the src/lib/plumed static executable
and delete or rename the compilation directory) PLUMED will 
not work correctly and will give you an
error message
\verbatim
> plumed help
ERROR: I cannot find /xxx/yyy/patches directory
\endverbatim
You can force plumed to run anyway by using the option --standalone-executable:
\verbatim
> plumed --standalone-executable help
\endverbatim
Many features will not be available if you run in this way. However, 
this is currently the only way to use the PLUMED static executable on Windows.

\section InstallingPlumed Installing PLUMED

It might be convenient to install PLUMED in a predefined location.
This will allow you to remove the original compilation directory,
or to recompile a different PLUMED version in the same place.
Notice that installation *is optional*. Even from the compilation
directory, if the environment is properly set (see sourceme.sh file)
PLUMED should work.

To install PLUMED one should first decide the location. Just set
the environment variable PLUMED_PREFIX, then type "make install"
\verbatim
> export PLUMED_PREFIX=$HOME/opt
> make install
\endverbatim
If PLUMED_PREFIX is not set, it will be assumed to be
the one set when you configured with autoconf. So if you configured
using
\verbatim
> ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
> make
> make install
\endverbatim
Then the PLUMED_PREFIX will be set equal to $HOME/opt.
If the PLUMED_PREFIX is not set, it defaults to /usr/local.
The install command should be executed with root permissions (e.g. "sudo make install")
if you want to install PLUMED on a system directory.
Notice that upon installation PLUMED currently needs to relink a library. If
root user does not have access to compilers, "sudo -E make install" might solve
the issue.
An almost full copy of the compilation directory will
be installed into $PLUMED_PREFIX/lib/plumed/ directory. A link to the proper
PLUMED executable will be set up in $PLUMED_PREFIX/bin,
PLUMED include files will be copied to $PLUMED_PREFIX/include/plumed
and PLUMED libraries will be linked to $PLUMED_PREFIX/lib.

One should then set the environment properly. We suggest to do it using
the module framework (http://modules.sourceforge.net). An ad hoc generated
module file for PLUMED can be found in $PLUMED_PREFIX/lib/plumed/src/lib/modulefile
Just edit it as you wish and put it in your modulefile directory.
This will also allow you to install multiple PLUMED versions on your machine and to
switch amongst them. If you do not want to use modules, you can 
still have a look at the modulefile we did so as to know which
environment variables should be set for PLUMED to work correctly.

If the environment is properly configured one should be able to do
the following things:
- use the "plumed" executable from the command line. This is also possible before installing.
- link against the PLUMED library using the "-lplumed" flag for the linker. This allows
  one to use PLUMED library in general purpose programs
- use the PLUMED internal functionalities (C++ classes) including
  header files such as "#include <plumed/tools/Vector.h>". This is useful as it may be expedient to
  exploit the PLUMED library in general purpose programs

As a final note, if you want to install several PLUMED versions without using modules then you can 
define the environment variable PLUMED_LIBSUFFIX using:
\verbatim
> export PLUMED_PREFIX=$HOME/opt
> export PLUMED_LIBSUFFIX=v2.0
> make install
\endverbatim
This will install a plumed executable named "plumed-v2.0". All the other files will be renamed similarly,
e.g. the PLUMED library will be loaded with "-lplumed-v2.0" and the PLUMED header files
will be included with "#include <plumed-v2.0/tools/Vector.h>". This trick is useful if you
do not want to set up modules, but we believe that using modules as described above is more flexible.

\section Patching Patching your MD code

In case your MD code is not supporting PLUMED already, you should modify it.
We provide scripts to adjust some of the most popular MD codes
so as to provide PLUMED support.
At the present times we support patching the following list of codes:

@CODESL@

In the section \subpage CodeSpecificNotes you can find information specific for each MD code.

To patch your MD code, you should have already installed PLUMED properly.
This is necessary as you need to have the command "plumed" in your execution
path.  As described above this executible will be in your paths if plumed was 
installed or if you have run sourceme.sh

Once you have a compiled and working version of plumed, follow these steps to add it to
an MD code
- Configure and compile your MD enginge (look for the instructions in its documentation).
- Test if the MD code is working properly.
- Go to the root directory for the source code of the MD engine.
- Patch with PLUMED using:
\verbatim
> plumed patch -p
\endverbatim
The script will interactively ask which MD engine you are patching.
- Once you have patched recompile the MD code (if dependencies are set up properly in the MD engine,
  only modified files will be recompiled)

There are different options available when patching. You can check all of them using 
\verbatim
> plumed patch --help
\endverbatim
Particularly interesting options include:
- --static (default) just link PLUMED as a collection of object files.
- --shared allows you to link PLUMED as a shared library. As a result when PLUMED is updated, there will be no need to recompile the MD code.
- --runtime allows you to choose the location of the PLUMED library at runtime by setting the variable PLUMED_KERNEL.

Notice that it is not currently possible to link PLUMED as a static library (something like 'libplumed.a').
The reason for this is that PLUMED heavily relies on C++ static constructors that do not behave well in static libraries.
For this reason, to produce a static executable with an MD code + PLUMED we link PLUMED as a collection of object files.

A note for cross compiling: if you are compiling an executable from a different machine, then then
"plumed" executable will not be available in the compilation environment. You should thus use the following command
\verbatim
> plumed-patch
\endverbatim
as a replacement for "plumed patch".

If your MD code is not supported, you may want to implement an interface for
it. Refer to the <a href="../../developer-doc/html/index.html"> developer
manual </a>.

\section installingalmost Installing PLUMED with ALMOST

In order to used some of the NMR based collective variables (\ref CS2BACKBONE and \ref CH3SHIFTS) PLUMED needs to be linked with ALMOST.
To do this the free package ALMOST v.2.1 MUST be dowloaded via SVN (svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/almost/code/ almost-code).
ALMOST 2.1 can be found in branches/almost-2.1/ and can be compiled:

\warning ALMOST needs SQLITE3 and  GZIP installed on your computer.
\warning ALMOST cannot be installed in the same folder of the source code, use --prefix to install it in a different folder

\verbatim
> ./configure --prefix="wherever you want it" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" 
> make
> make install
\endverbatim

Sometimes ALMOST can give errors related to the automake tools. To fix them it is often enough to execute
\verbatim
> autoreconf -fi
> automake
\endverbatim
and then repeat the configuration and compilation instructions.

PLUMED will not use the RDCs module of ALMOST so you can ignore the warning about LAPACK.

Once ALMOST is installed, PLUMED 2 can then be configured with ALMOST enabled: 

\verbatim
> ./configure --enable-almost CPPFLAGS="-I/ALMOST_INSTALL_PATH/include \
  -I/ALMOST_INSTALL_PATH/include/almost" LDFLAGS="-L/ALMOST_INSTALL_PATH/lib"
  
\endverbatim
with ALMOST_INSTALL_PATH set to the full path to the ALMOST installation folder.
