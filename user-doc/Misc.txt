\page comments Comments

If you are an organised sort of person who likes to remember what the hell you were trying to do when you ran a 
particular simulation you might find it useful to put comments in your input file.  In PLUMED you can do this as 
comments can be added using a # sign.  On any given line everything after the # sign is ignored so 
erm... yes add lines of comments or trailing comments to your hearts content as shown below (using Shakespeare is optional):

\verbatim
# This is the distance between two atoms:
DISTANCE ATOM=1,2 LABEL=d1
UPPER_WALLS ARG=d1 AT=3.0 KAPPA=3.0 LABEL=Snout # In this same interlude it doth befall. That I, one Snout by name, present a wall.
\endverbatim
(see \ref DISTANCE and \ref UPPER_WALLS)

An alternative to including comments in this way is to use line starting ENDPLUMED.  Everything in the PLUMED input after this
keyword will be ignored.

\page ContinuationLines Continuation lines

If your input lines get very long then editing them using vi and other such text editors becomes a massive pain in the arse.  
We at PLUMED are aware of this fact and thus have provided a way of doing line continuations so as to make your life that much 
easier - aren't we kind?  Well no not really, we have to use this code too.  Anyway, you can do continuations by using the "..." syntax
as this makes this: 

\verbatim
DISTANCES ATOMS1=1,300 ATOMS2=1,400 ATOMS3=1,500
\endverbatim
(see \ref DISTANCES)

equivalent to this:

\verbatim
DISTANCES ...
# we can also insert comments here
  ATOMS1=1,300
# multiple kewords per line are allowed
  ATOMS2=1,400 ATOMS3=1,500
#empty lines are also allowed

... DISTANCES
\endverbatim

\page includes Including other files 

If, for some reason, you want to spread your PLUMED input over a number of files you can use \subpage INCLUDE as shown below:

\verbatim
INCLUDE FILE=filename
\endverbatim

So, for example, a single "plumed.dat" file:

\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
RESTRAINT ARG=dist
\endverbatim
(see \ref DISTANCE and \ref RESTRAINT)

could be split up into two files as shown below:
 
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
INCLUDE FILE=toBeIncluded.dat
\endverbatim
plus a "toBeIncluded.dat" file
\verbatim
RESTRAINT ARG=dist
\endverbatim

However, when you do this it is important to recognise that \ref INCLUDE is a real directive that is only resolved
after all the \ref comments have been stripped and the \ref ContinuationLines have been unrolled.  This means it
is not possible to do things like:

\verbatim
# this is wrong:
DISTANCE INCLUDE FILE=options.dat
RESTRAINT ARG=dist
\endverbatim

\page load Loading shared libraries

You can introduce new functionality into PLUMED by placing it directly into the src directory and recompiling the 
PLUMED libraries.  Alternatively, if you want to keep your code independent from the rest of PLUMED (perhaps
so you can release it independely - we won't be offended), then you can create your own dynamic library.  To use this 
in conjuction with PLUMED you can then load it at runtime by using the \subpage LOAD keyword as shown below:

\verbatim
LOAD FILE=library.so
\endverbatim
 
N.B.  If your system uses a different suffix for dynamic libraries (e.g. macs use .dylib) then PLUMED will try to 
automatically adjust the suffix accordingly.

\page degub Debugging the code

The \subpage DEBUG action provides some functionality for debugging the code that may be useful if you are doing 
very intensive development of the code of if you are running on a computer with a strange architecture.

\page exchange-patterns Changing exchange patterns in replica exchange

Using the \subpage RANDOM_EXCHANGES keyword it is possible to make exchanges betweem randomly
chosen replicas. This is useful e.g. for bias exchange metadynamics \cite{piana}.
