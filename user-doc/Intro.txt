\mainpage Introduction

\warning This is the manual for the development version of PLUMED. It might
contain buggy code. See this page: \ref CHANGES-UNRELEASED

PLUMED is a plugin that works with a large number of molecular dynamics codes.  It can be used
to analyse features of the dynamics on-the-fly or to perform a wide variety of free energy methods.
The original PLUMED 1 was highly successful and had over 1000 users.  PLUMED 2 \cite plumed2 constitues an 
extensive rewrite of the original in a way that makes it more modular and thus easier to implement 
new methods, more straightforward to add it to MD codes and hopefully simpler to use.  
This is the user manual -  if you want to modify PLUMED or to understand how it works internally, have a look at the 
<a href="../../developer-doc/html/index.html"> developer manual </a>.

To know the difference between PLUMED 1 and PLUMED 2, and to
follow the development of PLUMED 2, you can checkout the detailed changelog:
- Changes for \ref CHANGES-2-0

A short tutorial explaining how to move from PLUMED 1 to PLUMED 2 is also available (see \ref moving)

To install PLUMED 2, see this page: \ref Installation

\section qintro A quick introduction

To run PLUMED 2 you need to provide one input file.  In this file you specify what it
is that PLUMED should do during the course of the run.  Typically this will involve calculating 
one or more collective variables, perhaps calculating a function of these CVs
 and then doing some analysis of values of your collective variables/functions or running
some free energy method. A very brief introduction to the syntax used in the PLUMED input file
is provided in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxJP16qNCYs"> 10-minute video </a>.

More information on the input syntax as well as details on the the various trajectory
analsyis tools that come with PLUMED are given in: 

- \ref Colvar tells you about the functions of the positions atoms that PLUMED can calculate.
- \ref Function tells you about the functions of collective variables that PLUMED can calculate.
- \ref Analysis tells you about the various forms of analysis you can run on trajectories using PLUMED.
- \ref Bias tells you about the methods that you can use to bias molecular dynamics simulations with PLUMED.

PLUMED can be used in one of two ways.  It can be incorporated into any one of the MD codes listed on the
\ref Installation page and used to analyse or bias a molecular dynamics run on the fly.  Alternatively, one
can use it as a standalone tool for postprocessing the results from molecular dynamics or enhanced sampling calculations.
