\page Bias Bias

PLUMED allows you to run a number of enhanced sampling algorithms.
The list of enhanced sampling algorithms contained in PLUMED is as follows: 

@BIAS@

Methods, such as \ref METAD, that work by introducing a history dependent bias can be restarted 
using the \subpage RESTART keyword

You can also use PLUMED in conjunction with VMD's interactive MD module by taking
advantage of the \subpage IMD action.
