\page Colvar Collective Variables

Chemical systems contain an enormous number atoms, which, in most cases makes it simply impossible for
us to understand anything by monitoring the atom postions directly.  Consquentially,
we introduce Collective variables (CVs) that describe the chemical processes we are 
interested in and monitor these simpler quantities instead.  These CVs are used in all of the methods 
implemented in plumed - they're values can be monitored using \ref PRINT, \ref Function of them can be calculated
or they can be analyzed or biased using the \ref Methods implemented in plumed.  Before doing any of these things
however we first have to inform plumed how to calculate them.    
 
\section atomSpecs Specifying Atoms

The vast majority of the CVs implemented in plumed are calculated from a list of atom positions.  Within plumed
atoms are always specified according to their numerical indices in the molecular dynamics input file.  This can
be done either using a comma separated list of numbers or, if a long list atom of contiguous atoms is required, 
by using the shortcut 10-100, which specifies all the atom indexes between 10 and 100 (including 10 and 100).  So for example:

\verbatim
TORSION ATOMS=1,2,3,4
\endverbatim

could also be specified using:

\verbatim
TORIONS ATOMS=1-4
\endverbatim

In addition, for certain colvars, pdb files can be read in using the following keywords:

@TOPOLOGIES@

The read in pdb files are used by plumed to define things like residues, the backbone atoms and so on.  These can then be
used within the input to colvars to make inputting the lists of atoms involved more straightforward.  Documentation for 
how these shortcuts can be used can be found in the documentation for the various CVs.

\section vatoms Virtual Atoms

Sometimes, when calculating a colvar, you may not want to use the positions of a number of atoms directly.  Instead
 you may wish to use the position of a virtual atom whose position is generated based on the positions of a collection 
of other atoms.  For example you might want to use the center of mass of a group of atoms.  Plumed has a number of routines
for calculating the positions of these virtual atoms from lists of atoms:

@VATOM@

To specify to a colvar that you want to use the position of a virtual atom to calculate a colvar rather than one of the atoms
in your system you simply use the label for your virtual atom in place of the usual numerical index.  Virtual
atoms and normal atoms can be mixed together in the input to colvars as shown below:

\verbatim
COM ATOMS=1,10 LABEL=com1
DISTANCE ATOMS=11,com1
\endverbatim 

If you don't want to calculate CVs from the virtual atom.  That is to say you just want to monitor the position of a virtual atom 
(or any set of atoms) over the course of your trajectory you can do this using \ref DUMPATOMS.

\section mols Molecules

PLUMED is designed so that for the majority of the CVs implemented the periodic boundary conditions are treated 
in the same manner as they would be treated in the host code.  In some codes this can be problematic when the colvars
you are using involve some property of a molecule.  These codes allow the atoms in the molecules to become separated by 
periodic boundaries, a fact which plumed could only deal with were the topology passed from the MD code to plumed.  Making this
work would involve a lot laborious programming and goes against our original aim of having a general patch that can be implemented 
in a wide variety of MD codes.  Consequentially, we have implemented a more pragmatic solution to this probem - the user specifies
in input any molecules (or parts of molecules) that must be kept in tact throughout the simulation run.  In plumed 1.0 this was done
using the ALIGN_ATOMS keyword.  In plumed 2.0 the same effect can be acchieved using any one from the following list of commands

@TOPOLOGIES@

The most general of these is the \ref WHOLEMOLECULES keywords.  However, there are advantages in using the others as oftentimes
by defining a topology using a pdb file you can take advantage of shortcuts when specifying other colvars.  For example, if you
use the \ref PROTEIN_TOPOLOGY keyword you can then later refer to the atoms in a specific residue by the residue number.

\section cvmodifiers Colvar Modifiers

In plumed 1.0 a single line in the input instructed plumed to calculate one CV.  This is not the case in plumed 2.0 - now a single
line in input can be used to specify the calculation of multiple colvars.  As discussed in the documentation for each colvar this can
be done explicitally, by defining 10 lists of atoms to calculate 10 colvars for example, or implicitally through shortcuts.  The duly 
calculated lists of colvars can then be used directly by other Actions, in which case they can be referenced using <label>.value1, 
<label>.value2, ... or functions of the distribution of colvars can be calculated directly.  Currently, the following functions are available:

- MIN - (referenced using <label>.min) the minimum from amongst the calculated colvars
- MAX - (referenced using <label>.max) the maximum from amongst the calculated colvars
- SUM - (referenced using <label>.sum) the sum of all the colvars calculated
- AVERAGE - (referenced using <label>.average) the average colvar
- LESS_THAN - (referenced using <label>.less_than<number>) the number of colvars less than <number>
- MORE_THAN - (referenced using <label>.more_than<number>) the number of colvars more than <number>    

Combinations of the above can defined on a single line in input.  Alternatively (these keywords can't be mixed with the above)
 the number of values within a particular range can be specified using WITHIN_RANGE or a histogram of the collective variable values 
can be calculated using HISTOGRAM.  More detailed documentation on these features can be found within the documentation for the colvars.

\section ugroups Using Groups

In plumed 1.0 it was possible to specify groups of atoms in the input and to use the groups defined in multiple colvars.  
This feature has been retained in plumed 2.0 and also extended.  In plumed 2.0 groups can be used to specify a fixed set of atoms or to 
specify a set of atoms that changes as a function of time.  The various keywords for specifying these groups of atoms are:

@GROUP@ 

Groups are given a label and as specified in the CV documentation the GROUP keyword can take as input the labels for groups
