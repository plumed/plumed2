\page belfast-6 Belfast tutorial: Metadynamics

\section Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce the users to running a metadynamics calculation using PLUMED. We will set up
a simple calculation on alanine dipeptide in vacuum, analyse the output, and calculate free energies
from the simulation. We will also learn how to run a well-tempered metadynamics simulation and 
detect issues related to a bad choice of collective variables.

\section belfast-6-theory Summary of theory

In a metadynamics simulations a history dependent bias composed of 
intermittently added Gaussian functions is added to the potential \cite metad.

\f[
V(\vec{s},t) = \sum_{ k \tau < t} W(k \tau)
\exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i-s_i^{(0)}(k \tau))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right).
\f]

This potential forces the system away from the kinetic traps in the potential energy surface
and out into the unexplored parts of the energy landscape. Information on the Gaussian
functions from which this potential is composed is output to a file called HILLS, which 
is used both the restart the simulation and to reconstruct the free energy as a function of the CVs. 
The free energy can be reconstructed from a metadynamics simulation because the final bias is given
by: 

\f[
V(\vec{s}) = -F(\vec(s))
\f]

During post processing the free energy can be calculated in this way using the \ref sum_hills
utility.

Another option that is available in PLUMED 2.0 is well-tempered metadynamics \cite Barducci:2008. In this
varient of metadynamics the heights of the Gaussian hills are rescaled at each step so the bias is now
given by:

\f[
V({s},t)= \sum_{t'=0,\tau_G,2\tau_G,\dots}^{t'<t} W e^{-V({s}({q}(t'),t')/\Delta T} \exp\left(
-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{(s_i({q})-s_i({q}(t'))^2}{2\sigma_i^2}
\right),
\f]

This method ensures that the bias converges more smoothly. 

Additional information can be found in the several review papers on metadynamics 
\cite gerv-laio09review \cite WCMS:WCMS31 \cite WCMS:WCMS1103.

\section belfast-6-instructions Instructions

\subsection belfast-6-system The model system

We here use as model system alanine dipeptide with CHARM27 all atom force field already seen in the previous section.

\subsection belfast-6-exercise-1 Exercise 1. Setup and run a metadynamics simulation 

In this exercise, we will run a metadynamics simulation on alanine dipeptide in vacuum, using as CVs the
two backbone dihedral angles phi and psi. 
In order to run this simulations we need to prepare the PLUMED input file as follows.

\verbatim
# set up two variables for Phi and Psi dihedral angles 
phi: TORSION ATOMS=5,7,9,15
psi: TORSION ATOMS=7,9,15,17
#
# Activate metadynamics in phi and psi
# depositing a Gaussian every 500 time steps,
# with height equal to 1.2 kJoule/mol,
# and width 0.35 rad for both CVs. 
#
metad: METAD ARG=phi,psi PACE=500 HEIGHT=1.2 SIGMA=0.35,0.35 FILE=HILLS 

# monitor the two variables and the metadynamics bias potential
PRINT STRIDE=10 ARG=phi,psi,metad.bias FILE=COLVAR

\endverbatim
(see \ref TORSION, \ref METAD, and \ref PRINT).

The syntax for the command \ref METAD is rather trivial.
The directive is followed by a keyword ARG followed by the labels of the CVs
on which the metadynamics potential will act.
The keyword PACE determines the stride of Gaussian deposition in number of time steps,
while the keyword HEIGHT specifies the height of the Gaussian in kJoule/mol. For each CVs, one has
to specified the width of the Gaussian by using the keyword SIGMA. Gaussian will be written
to the file indicated by the keyword FILE. 

Once the PLUMED input file is prepared, one has to run Gromacs with the option to activate PLUMED and
read the input file (plumed.dat):

\verbatim
mdrun_mpi -plumed plumed.dat
\endverbatim

During the metadynamics simulation, PLUMED will create two files, named COLVAR and HILLS.
The COLVAR file contains all the information specified by the PRINT command, in this case
the value of the CVs every 10 steps of simulation, along with the current value of the metadynamics
bias potential. The HILLS file contains a list of the Gaussian deposited along the simulation.
If we give a look at the header of this file, we can find relevant information about its content:

\verbatim
#! FIELDS time phi psi sigma_phi sigma_psi height biasf
#! SET multivariate false
#! SET min_phi -pi
#! SET max_phi pi
#! SET min_psi -pi
#! SET max_psi pi
\endverbatim 

The line starting with FIELDS tells us what is displayed in the various columns of the HILLS file:
the time of the simulation, the value of phi and psi, the width of the Gaussian in phi and psi, and
the height of the Gaussian. The last column contains the so-called bias-factor, which is the ratio
of the CV temperature and the temperature of the simulation. This quantity is relevant only for
well-tempered metadynamics simulation (see \ref belfast-6-exercise-4) and it is equal to 1 in standard
metadynamics simulations.
We will use the HILLS file later to calculate free-energies from the metadynamics simulation and assess its convergence.
For the moment, we can plot the behavior of the CVs during the simulation.

\anchor belfast-6-metad-fig
\image html belfast-6-metad.png "Time evolution of the CVs during the first nanosecond of a metadynamics simulation of alanine dipeptide in vacuum."

By inspecting Figure \ref belfast-6-metad-fig, we can see that the system is initialized in one of the two metastable
states of alanine dipeptide. After a while (t=0.3 ns), the system is pushed
by the metadynamics bias potential to visit the other local minimum. As the simulation continues,
the bias potential fills the underlying free-energy landscape, and the system is able to diffuse in the
entire phase space.

If we use the PLUMED input file described above, the expense of a metadynamics
simulation increases with the length of the simulation as one has to evaluate
the values of a larger and larger number of Gaussians at every step. To avoid this issue you can
store the bias on a grid. In order to use grids, we have to add some additional information to the line of the \ref METAD
directive, as follows.

\verbatim
# set up two variables for Phi and Psi dihedral angles
phi: TORSION ATOMS=5,7,9,15
psi: TORSION ATOMS=7,9,15,17
#
# Activate metadynamics in phi and psi
# depositing a Gaussian every 500 time steps,
# with height equal to 1.2 kJoule/mol,
# and width 0.35 rad for both CVs.
# The bias potential will be stored on a grid
# with bin size equal to 0.1 rad for both CVs. 
# The boundaries of the grid are -pi and pi, for both CVs.
#
METAD ...
LABEL=metad
ARG=phi,psi 
PACE=500
HEIGHT=1.2
SIGMA=0.35,0.35
FILE=HILLS
GRID_MIN=-pi,-pi
GRID_MAX=pi,pi
GRID_SPACING=0.1,0.1 
... METAD

# monitor the two variables and the metadynamics bias potential
PRINT STRIDE=10 ARG=phi,psi,metad.bias FILE=COLVAR

\endverbatim

The bias potential will be stored on a grid, whose boundaries are specified by the keyword GRID_MIN and GRID_MAX.
Notice that you should provide either the number of bins for every collective variable (GRID_BIN) or
the desired grid spacing (GRID_SPACING). In case you provide both PLUMED will use
the most conservative choice (highest number of bins) for each dimension.
In case you do not provide any information about bin size (neither GRID_BIN nor GRID_SPACING)
and if Gaussian width is fixed PLUMED will use 1/5 of the Gaussian width as grid spacing.
This default choice should be reasonable for most applications.

\subsection belfast-6-exercise-2 Exercise 2. Restart a metadynamics simulation 

If we try to run again a metadynamics simulation using the script above in a directory where
a COLVAR and HILLS files are already present, PLUMED will create a backup copy of the old files,
and run a new simulation. Instead, if we want to restart a previous simulation, we have to add
the keyword RESTART to the input file, as follows.

\verbatim
# restart previous simulation
RESTART

# set up two variables for Phi and Psi dihedral angles 
phi: TORSION ATOMS=5,7,9,15
psi: TORSION ATOMS=7,9,15,17
#
# Activate metadynamics in phi and psi
# depositing a Gaussian every 500 time steps,
# with height equal to 1.2 kJoule/mol,
# and width 0.35 rad for both CVs. 
#
metad: METAD ARG=phi,psi PACE=500 HEIGHT=1.2 SIGMA=0.35,0.35 FILE=HILLS 

# monitor the two variables and the metadynamics bias potential
PRINT STRIDE=10 ARG=phi,psi,metad.bias FILE=COLVAR

\endverbatim
(see \ref RESTART, \ref TORSION, \ref METAD, and \ref PRINT).

In this way, PLUMED will read the old Gaussians from the HILLS file and append the new information
to both COLVAR and HILLS files.

\subsection belfast-6-exercise-3 Exercise 3. Calculate free-energies and monitor convergence

One can estimate the free energy as a function of the metadynamics CVs directly from the metadynamics
bias potential. In order to do so, the utility \ref sum_hills should be used to sum the Gaussians
deposited during the simulations and stored in the HILLS file.  

To calculate the two-dimensional free energy as a function of phi and psi, it is sufficient to use the 
following command line:

\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS
\endverbatim

The command above generates a file called fes.dat in which the free-energy surface as function
of phi and psi is calculated on a regular grid. One can modify the default name for the free energy file,
as well as the boundaries and bin size of the grid, by using the following options of sum_hills:

\verbatim
--min - the lower bounds for the grid
--max - the upper bounds for the grid
--bin - the number of bins for the grid
--spacing - grid spacing, alternative to the number of bins
\endverbatim 

It is also possible to calculate one-dimensional free energies from the two-dimensional metadynamics simulation. 
For example, if one is interested in the free energy as a function of the phi dihedral alone, the following
command line should be used:

\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS --idw phi --kt 2.5
\endverbatim

The result should look like this:

\anchor belfast-7-phifes-fig
\image html belfast-7-phifes.png "Estimate of the free energy as a function of the dihedral phi from a 5ns-long metadynamics simulation using 2 CVs, the dihedrals phi and psi."

To assess the convergence of a metadynamics simulation, one can calculate the estimate of the free energy as a function
of simulation time. At convergence, the reconstructed profiles should be similar, apart from a constant offset.
The option --stride should be used to give an estimate of the free energy every N Gaussians deposited, and
the option --mintozero can be used to align the profiles by setting the global minimum to zero.
If we use the following command line:

\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS --idw phi --kt 2.5 --stride 500 --mintozero
\endverbatim

one free energy is calculated every 500 Gaussians deposited, and the global minimum is set to zero in all profiles.
The resulting plot should look like the following:

\anchor belfast-8-phifest-fig
\image html belfast-8-phifest.png "Estimates of the free energy as a function of the dihedral phi calculated every 500 Gaussians deposited along a 5ns-long metadynamics simulation using 2 CVs."

To assess the convergence of the simulation more quantitatively, we can calculate the free energy difference between the two
local minima in the one-dimensional free energy along phi as a function of simulation time.


This analysis along with the observation of the diffusive behavior in the CVs space suggest that the simulation is converged.
