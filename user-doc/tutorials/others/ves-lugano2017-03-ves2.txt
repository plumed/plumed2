\section ves-lugano2017-ves2-sumtheo Summary of theory

One of the most useful target distribution is the well-tempered one.
The well-tempered target distribution is \cite Valsson-JCTC-2015 :
\f[
p(\mathbf{s})=\frac{e^{-(\beta/\gamma) F(\mathbf{s})}}{\int d\mathbf{s} \, e^{- (\beta/\gamma) F(\mathbf{s})}}
\f]
where \f$ \gamma \f$ is the so-called bias
factor. It is possible to show that:
\f[
p(\mathbf{s}) =
\frac{[ P(\mathbf{s}) ]^{1/\gamma}}
{\int d\mathbf{s}\, [ P(\mathbf{s}) ]^{1/\gamma}}


\f]
where \f$ P(\mathbf{s}) \f$ is the unbiased distribution of CVs. Therefore the
target distribution is the unbiased distribution with enhanced fluctuations
and lowered barriers. This is the same distribution as sampled in well-tempered
metadynamics. The advantages of this distribution are that the features of the
FES (metastable states) are preserved and that the system is not forced to sample regions of high
free energy as it would if we had chosen the uniform target distribution. This
is specially important when biasing 2 CVs and there are large regions of very
high free energy and therefore they represent un-physical configurations.

There is a caveat though, \f$ p(\mathbf{s}) \f$ depends on \f$
F(\mathbf{s})\f$ that is the function that we are trying to calculate.
One way to approach this problem is to calculate \f$ p(\mathbf{s}) \f$
self-consistently \cite Valsson-JCTC-2015, for instance at iteration \f$ k \f$:
\f[
p^{(k+1)}(\mathbf{s})=\frac{e^{-(\beta/\gamma) F^{(k+1)}(\mathbf{s})}}{\int d\mathbf{s} \, e^{-(\beta/\gamma) F^{(k+1)}(\mathbf{s})}}
\f]
where:
\f[
F^{(k+1)}(\mathbf{s})=-V^{(k)}(\mathbf{s}) - \frac{1}{\beta} \log p^{(k)}(\mathbf{s})
\f]
Normally \f$ p^{(0)}(\mathbf{s}) \f$ is taken to be uniform.
Therefore the target distribution evolves in time until it becomes stationary
when the simulation has converged. It has been shown that in some cases the
convergence is faster using the well-tempered target distribution than using
the uniform \f$ p(\mathbf{s}) \f$ \cite Valsson-JCTC-2015.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-ves2-subsection-1 The system

We will consider the same system employed in previous tutorials.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-ves2-subsection-3 Example 1: Enhancing fluctuations

We consider Example 2 of the VES 1 tutorial. In that case we used a uniform
target distribution that at some value decayed to zero. In this case we will
use a product of two distributions:
\f[
p(s)=\frac{p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s) \, p_{\mathrm{barrier}}(s)}
{\int ds \, p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s) \, p_{\mathrm{barrier}}(s)}
\f]
where \f$ p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s) \f$ is the well-tempered target distribution and:

MISSING EQUATION TO BE FIXED

with \f$ C \f$ a normalization factor.
The files needed for this exercise are in the directory Example1.
This target distribution can be specified in plumed using:
\plumedfile
__FILL__
td_uniform: TD_UNIFORM MINIMA=0.23 MAXIMA=0.6 SIGMA_MAXIMA=0.05 
td_welltemp: TD_WELLTEMPERED BIASFACTOR=5
td_combination: TD_PRODUCT_COMBINATION DISTRIBUTIONS=td_uniform,td_welltemp

 ARG=d1
 BASIS_FUNCTIONS=bf1
 LABEL=b1
 TEMP=300.0
 GRID_BINS=300
 TARGET_DISTRIBUTION=td_combination
... VES_LINEAR_EXPANSION
\endplumedfile
As usual, we run the example using the run.sh script.
As the simulation progresses we can track the evolution of the target
distribution. At variance with previous simulations where \f$ p(s) \f$ was
stationary, in this case it evolves in time. The \f$ p(s) \f$ is dumped every
500 steps in a file named targetdist.b1.iter-<iteration-number>.data.
You can plot these files manually or using the script plotTargetDistrib.gpi.
The result should be similar to the following plot where the distribution at
different times has been shifted to see more clearly the difference.

To shed some light on the nature of the well-tempered target distribution, we
will compare the unbiased and biased distribution of CVs.
The unbiased distribution of CVs \f$ P(s) \f$ is calculated by constructing a
histogram of the CVs with weights given by:
\f[
  w(\mathbf{R}) \propto  e^{\beta V(\mathbf{s})}.
\f]
The biased distribution of CVs \f$ p'(s) \f$ is calculated also by
constructing a histogram of the CVs but in this case each point is assigned
equal weights. The prime is added in \f$ p'(s) \f$ to distinguish the biased
distribution from the target distribution \f$ p(s) \f$. If the simulation has
converged then \f$ p'(s) = p(s) \f$.
The files needed for this calculation are located in the Reweight directory.
Since this simulation converges fast as compared to previous ones, we only
disregard the first 1 ns of simulation:
\verbatim
sed '2,5000d' ../COLVAR > COLVAR
\endverbatim
To calculate the biased and unbiased distribution of CVs we use the following
PLUMED input:
\plumedfile
__FILL__
distance:       READ FILE=COLVAR  IGNORE_TIME VALUES=d1
ves:       READ FILE=COLVAR IGNORE_TIME VALUES=b1.bias

weights: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=300 ARG=ves.bias

HISTOGRAM ...

  GRID_MIN=0.23
  GRID_MAX=0.8
  GRID_BIN=301
  BANDWIDTH=0.006

... HISTOGRAM

DUMPGRID GRID=hh1 FILE=histo_biased FMT=%24.16e
DUMPGRID GRID=hh2 FILE=histo_unbiased FMT=%24.16e
\endplumedfile
If you do not understand what this input does, you might want to read once
again the previous tutorials.
The histograms histo_biased and histo_unbiased correspond to \f$ p'(s) \f$ and
\f$ P(s) \f$ , respectively.
We are interested in comparing the unbiased distribution of CVs \f$ P(s) \f$
and the well-tempered distribution \f$ p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s)\f$. We know from the
equations above that:
\f[
 p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s) \propto [ P(\mathbf{s}) ]^{1/\gamma},
\f]
and also,
\f[
 p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s) \propto p(s)/p_{\mathrm{barrier}}(s) \propto p'(s)/p_{\mathrm{barrier}}(s) .
\f]
Therefore we have two ways to calculate the well-tempered target distribution.
We can compare \f$ P(s) \f$ and the well-tempered target distribution
calculated in two ways with the following gnuplot lines:
\verbatim
biasFactor=5.
invBiasFactor=1./biasFactor
pl "./histo_unbiased" u 1:(-log($2)) w l title "P(s)"
repl "./histo_unbiased" u 1:(-log($2**invBiasFactor)) w l title "[P(s)]^(1/gamma)"
repl "< paste ./histo_biased ../targetdist.b1.iter-0.data" u 1:(-log($2/$5)) w l title "Sampled p(s)"
\endverbatim
There is also a gnuplot script plot.gpi that should do everything for you.
The output should be similar to the next plot where we plot the negative
logarithm of the distributions.

\anchor ves-school-2017-ves2-well-tempered
\image html ves-lugano2017-ves2_well-tempered.png "Unbiased distribution of CVs P(s) and well-tempered distribution calculated in two ways"

Notice that as expected both equations to calculate \f$ p_{\mathrm{WT}}(s)\f$ agree.
Also the association barrier of \f$ 5 \: k_{\mathrm{B}} T \f$ becomes of \f$ 1 \: k_{\mathrm{B}} T
\f$ when the well-tempered target distribution is sampled.

The take home message of this tutorial is that when the well-tempered
target distribution is employed, the biased distribution of CVs preserves
all the features of the unbiased distribution, but barriers are lowered.
Equivalently one may say that fluctuations are enhanced.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-ves2-subsection-4 Example 2: Constructing a 2 dimensional bias

In this example we will construct a 2 dimensional bias on the distance Na-Cl
and the coordination number of Na with respect to O.
The files to run this example are included in the Example2 folder.
Two dimensional biases in VES can be written:
\f[
V(s_1,s_2;\boldsymbol\alpha)=\sum\limits_{i_1,i_2} \alpha_{i_1,i_2} \,
f_{i_1}(s_1)\,  f_{i_2}(s_2) ,
\f]
where \f$ f_{i_1}(s_1)\f$ and \f$ f_{i_2}(s_2) \f$ are the basis functions.
We will choose to expand the bias potential in Legendre polynomials up to
order 20 in both dimensions.
\plumedfile
__FILL__
# CV1
BF_LEGENDRE ...
 ORDER=20
 MINIMUM=0.23
 MAXIMUM=0.8
 LABEL=bf1
... BF_LEGENDRE

# CV2
BF_LEGENDRE ...
 ORDER=20
 MINIMUM=2.5
 MAXIMUM=7.5
 LABEL=bf2
... BF_LEGENDRE
\endplumedfile
We have chosen the interval [0.23,0.8] nm for the distance and [2.5,7.5] for
the coordination number.
The total number of non-zero coefficients will be 400.
In the coefficients file the indices \f$i_{1}\f$ and \f$i_{2}\f$
are given by the first two columns.
We use the well-tempered target distribution together with a barrier at 0.6 nm
on the distance Na-Cl.
\plumedfile
__FILL__
td_uniform: TD_UNIFORM MINIMA=0.2,2.5 MAXIMA=0.6,7.5 SIGMA_MAXIMA=0.05,0.0
td_welltemp: TD_WELLTEMPERED BIASFACTOR=5
td_combination: TD_PRODUCT_COMBINATION DISTRIBUTIONS=td_uniform,td_welltemp

VES_LINEAR_EXPANSION ...
 ARG=d1,coord
 BASIS_FUNCTIONS=bf1,bf2
 LABEL=b1
 TEMP=300.0
 GRID_BINS=300,300
 TARGET_DISTRIBUTION=td_combination
... VES_LINEAR_EXPANSION
\endplumedfile
We can now run the simulation and control its progress.
Since there are 400 coefficients we choose the largest (in absolute value) to control the
convergence of the simulation. In this case we have chosen coefficients with
indices \f$(i_{1},i_{2})\f$ as (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), and (0,2).
You can plot the evolution of the coefficients
using the gnuplot script plotCoeffs.gpi.
This plot should look similar to the
following one. The bias
therefore converges smoothly as in one dimensional problems.

\anchor ves-school-2017-ves2-2d-coeffs
\image html ves-lugano2017-ves2_2D-coeffs.png "Evolution of the largest coefficients"

The estimated FES can also be plotted to control the progress of the
simulation. For instance in gnuplot,
\verbatim
set xr [0.23:0.7]
set yr [3:7]
set zr [0:6]
set cbr [0:6]
set pm3d map
temp=2.494
spl "./fes.b1.iter-1000.data" u 1:2:($3/temp) w pm3d notitle
\endverbatim
There is a gnuplot script plotFes.gpi that generates the following plot for
the FES after 10 ns of simulation:

\anchor ves-school-2017-ves2-2d-fes
\image html ves-lugano2017-ves2_2D-fes.png "FES estimated from the 2D bias after 10 ns"

This FES agrees with that calculated through reweighting in the metadynamics
tutorial.

As an exercise, you can repeat this simulation using the uniform target
distribution instead of the well-tempered \f$ p(s) \f$. Compare the
convergence time of both simulations. Discuss the reasons why the algorithm
converges faster to the well-tempered target distribution than to the uniform
one. Does it make sense to sample all the CV space uniformly?

\section ves-lugano2017-ves2-final Final remarks

At this point the student has acquired experience with several
characteristics of the VES method. There is one tool that has proven to be
instrumental for many problems and that has not yet been discussed in this
series of tutorials: the use of multiple walkers.
This tool will be the subject of another tutorial.
