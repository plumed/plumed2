\page lugano-1 Lugano tutorial: Introduction to PLUMED syntax and analyzing CVs

\section lugano-1-aims Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce you to the PLUMED syntax. We will go through the writing of input files to calculate
and print simple collective variables on a pre-calculated trajectory.

\section lugano-1-lo Learning Outcomes

Once this tutorial is completed, students will be able to:

- Write a simple PLUMED input file and use it with the PLUMED \ref driver to analyze a trajectory.
- Print collective variables such as distances.
  (\ref DISTANCE), torsional angles (\ref TORSION), gyration radius (\ref GYRATION), and RMSD (\ref RMSD) using the \ref PRINT action.
- Use \ref MOLINFO shortcuts.
- Define and use virtual atoms, such as \ref CENTER.
- Take care of periodic boundary conditions within PLUMED using \ref WHOLEMOLECULES and be able to verify the result with \ref DUMPATOMS.
- Write their own CVs directly in the input file using the \ref COMBINE action.

\section lugano-1-resources Resources

The reference trajectories and other files needed for the exercises proposed in this tutorial
can be downloaded from `github` using the following command:

\verbatim
wget https://github.com/plumed/lugano2019/raw/master/handson_1/handson_1.tgz
\endverbatim

The zip archive contains the following files:
- GB1_native.pdb : A PDB file with the native structure of the GB1 protein.
- traj-whole.xtc: A trajectory in xtc format. To make the exercise easier, GB1 has been made whole already.
- traj-broken.xtc: The same trajectory as it was originally produced by GROMACS. Here GB1 is broken by periodic boundary conditions and should be fixed.

This tutorial has been tested on a pre-release version of PLUMED 2.6. However, it should also work with PLUMED version 2.5.

\section lugano-1-instructions Instructions

PLUMED is a library that can be incorporated into many MD codes by adding a relatively simple and well documented interface.
Once it is incorporated you can use PLUMED to perform a variety of different analyzes on the fly and to bias 
the sampling in the molecular dynamics engine.  PLUMED can also, however, be used as a standalone code for analyzing trajectories.
If you are using the code in this way you can, once PLUMED is compiled, run the plumed executable by issuing the command:

\verbatim
plumed <instructions>
\endverbatim

Let's start by getting a feel for the range of calculations that we can use PLUMED to perform.  Issue the following command now:

\verbatim
plumed --help 
\endverbatim

What is output when this command is run is a list of the tasks you can use PLUMED to perform.  There are commands that allow you
to patch an MD code, commands that allow you to run molecular dynamics and commands that allow you to build the manual.  In this
tutorial we will mostly be using PLUMED to analyze trajectories, however.  As such most of the calculations we will perform will be performed 
using the driver tool.  Let's look at the options we can issue to plumed driver by issuing the following command:  

\verbatim
plumed driver --help
\endverbatim

As you can see we can do a number of things with plumed driver. For all of these options, however, we are going to need to write 
a PLUMED input file. The syntax of the PLUMED input file is the same that we will use later to run enhanced sampling simulations,
so all the things that you will learn now will be useful later when you will run PLUMED coupled to an MD code.
In the following we are going to see how to write an input file for PLUMED.

\subsection lugano-1-units PLUMED's internal units

By default the PLUMED inputs and outputs quantities in the following units:

- Energy - kJ/mol
- Length - nanometers
- Time - picoseconds

If you want to change these units you can do this using the \ref UNITS keyword. 

\section lugano-1-structure The syntax of the PLUMED input file

The main goal of PLUMED is to compute collective variables, which are complex descriptors than can be used
to analyze a conformational change or a chemical reaction. This can be done either on-the-fly during
molecular dynamics or a posteriori, using PLUMED as a post-processing tool. 
In both cases one, should create an input file with a specific PLUMED syntax. A sample input file is below:

\plumedfile
# Compute distance between atoms 1 and 10.
# Atoms are ordered as in the trajectory files and their numbering starts from 1.
# The distance is called "d" for future reference.
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10

# Create a virtual atom in the center between atoms 20 and 30.
# The virtual atom only exists within PLUMED and is called "center" for future reference.
center: CENTER ATOMS=20,30

# Compute the torsional angle between atoms 1, 10, 20, and center.
# Notice that virtual atoms can be used as real atoms here.
# The angle is called "phi" for future reference.
phi1: TORSION ATOMS=1,10,20,center

# the same CV defined before can be split into multiple line
TORSION ...
LABEL=phi2
ATOMS=1,10,20,center
...

# Print d every 10 step on a file named "COLVAR1".
PRINT ARG=d STRIDE=10 FILE=COLVAR1

# Print phi1 and phi2 on another file names "COLVAR2" every 100 steps.
PRINT ARG=phi1,phi2 STRIDE=100 FILE=COLVAR2
\endplumedfile

In the input file above, each line defines a so-called action. An action could either compute a distance,
or the center between two or more atoms, or print some value on a file. Each action supports a number of keywords,
whose value is specified. Action names are highlighted in green and, clicking on them, you can go to the
corresponding page in the manual that contains a detailed description for each keyword.
Actions that support the keyword `STRIDE` are those that determine how frequently things are to be done.
Notice that the default value for `STRIDE` is always 1. In the example above, omitting `STRIDE` keywords
the corresponding COLVAR files would have been written for every frame of the analyzed trajectory.
All the other actions in the example above do not 
support the `STRIDE` keyword and are only calculated when requested. That is, `d` will be computed
every 10 frames, and `phi1` and `phi2` every 100 frames.
In short, you can think that for every snapshot in the trajectory that you are analyzing PLUMED
is going to execute all the listed actions, though some of them are optimized out when `STRIDE` is different from 1.

Variables should be given a name (in the example above, `d`, `phi1`, and `phi2`), which is
then used to refer to these variables.
Lists of atoms should be provided as
comma separated numbers, with no space. Virtual atoms can be created and assigned a name for later use.

You can find more information on the PLUMED syntax
at \ref Syntax page of the manual. The complete documentation for all the supported
collective variables can be found at the \ref colvarintro page.

\section lugano-1-ex Exercises


\subsection lugano-1-ex-1 Exercise 1: Computing and printing simple collective variables

In this exercise, we will make practice with computing and printing collective variables.
To analyze the trajectories provided here, you should:
- Create a PLUMED input file with a text editor (let us call it `plumed.dat`) similar to the one above.
- Run the command `plumed driver` command (see below)

Notice that you can also visualize trajectories with VMD directly. 
For example, the trajectory `traj-whole.xtc` can be visualized with
the command `vmd GB1_native.pdb traj-whole.xtc`.

Let's prepare a PLUMED input file that calculates
- The gyration radius of all CA protein atoms (\ref GYRATION). Look in the `GB1_native.pdb` file
  to retrieve the list of indexes of the CA atoms.
- The total number of contacts (\ref COORDINATION) between all protein CA atoms.
  For \ref COORDINATION, set reference distance `R_0` to 8.0 A (be careful with units!!).

Here you can find a sample `plumed.dat` file that you can use as a template.
Whenever you see an highlighted \highlight{FILL} string, this is a string that you should replace.

\plumedfile
# Compute gyration radius on CA atoms:
r: GYRATION ATOMS=__FILL__

# Compute number of contacts between CA atoms
co: COORDINATION GROUPA=__FILL__ R_0=__FILL__

# Print the collective variables on COLVAR file every step
PRINT ARG=r,co FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=__FILL__
\endplumedfile

Once your `plumed.dat` file is complete, you can use it with the following command
\verbatim
> plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_xtc traj-broken.xtc
\endverbatim

Scroll in your terminal to read the PLUMED log. As you can see,
PLUMED gives a lot of feedback about the input that he is reading. There's the
place where you can check if PLUMED understood correctly your input.

The command above will create a `COLVAR` file like this one:
\verbatim
#! FIELDS time r co
 0.000000 2.458704 165.184127
 1.000000 2.341932 164.546604
 2.000000 2.404708 162.606975
 3.000000 2.454297 143.850122
 4.000000 2.569342 147.110408
 5.000000 2.304027 163.608703
\endverbatim
Notice that the first line informs you about the content of each column.

__In case you obtain different numbers, check your input, you might have made some mistake!__

This file can then be shown with `gnuplot`
\verbatim
gnuplot> p "COLVAR" u 1:2, "" u 1:3
\endverbatim

Now, look at what happens if you run the exercise twice. The second time, PLUMED
will *back up* the previously produced file so as not to overwrite it.
You can also *concatenate* your files by using the action \ref RESTART at the beginning
of your input file.

Finally, let's try to use the same input file with `traj-whole.xtc` and examine the results.
Did you find the same results as with the previous trajectory? Why?

\subsection lugano-1-ex-2 Exercise 2:  MOLINFO shortcuts

In the previous sections we have seen how we can use PLUMED to calculate distances and how by plotting these distances we can begin to simplify the 
high dimensional data contained in a trajectory.  Obviously, calculating a \ref DISTANCE is not always the best way to simplify the information contained 
in a trajectory and we often find we have to work with other more-complex quantities.  PLUMED thus started as a library that was used to gather all the various 
implementations people had written for different collective variables (CVs) that people had used to "analyze" trajectories over the years (analyze is in 
inverted commas here because, as you will see if you continue to use PLUMED, we use CVs to do much more than simply analyze trajectories).  
Now we will not have time to go over all the quantities that can be calculated in this tutorial.  Once you understand the basic principles, however, you 
should be able to use the manual to work out how to calculate other quantities of interest.  With this in mind then lets learn how to calculate 
a \ref TORSION.  As with \ref DISTANCE the atoms that we specify in our \ref TORSION command can be real or virtual.  In the example below two
real atoms and a virtual atom are used:  

\verbatim
first: CENTER ATOMS=1-6
last: CENTER ATOMS=251-256
cvtor: TORSION ATOMS=first,102,138,last

PRINT ARG=cvtor STRIDE=1 FILE=COLVAR 

ENDPLUMED
\endverbatim

Copy this input to a PLUMED input file and use it to analyze the trajectory you downloaded at the start of this exercise by using the commands
described in section \ref lugano-1-introinput then plot the CV output using gnuplot.

As you can hopefully see calculating \ref TORSION values and other CVs is no more difficult than calculating \ref DISTANCE values.  In fact it is 
easier as generally when you calculate the torsion angles of a protein you often wish to calculate particular, named torsion angles (i.e. the \f$\phi\f$ and \f$\psi\f$
angles).  The \ref MOLINFO command makes it particularly easy to do this.  For instance suppose that you want to calculate and print the \f$\phi\f$ angle
in the sixth residue of the protein and the \f$\psi\f$ angle in the eighth residue of the protein.  You can do so using the following input:

\verbatim
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=template.pdb
phi6: TORSION ATOMS=@phi-6
psi8: TORSION ATOMS=@psi-8
PRINT ARG=phi6,psi8 FILE=colvar
\endverbatim

Copy this input to a PLUMED input file and use it to analyze the trajectory you downloaded at the start of this exercise by using the commands
described in section \ref lugano-1-introinput then plot the CV output using gnuplot.  Notice that you will need the template.pdb file you downloaded 
at the start of this exercise in order for this to run.


\subsection lugano-1-ex-3 Exercise 3: Virtual atoms

When calculating many collective variables it is useful to not think in terms of calculating them directly based on the positions of a number of atoms.
It is useful to instead think of them as being calculated from the position of one or more virtual atoms whose positions are generated based on the position
of a collection of other atoms.  For example you might want to calculate the distance between the center of masses of two molecules.  In this case it is useful
to calculate the two positions of the centers of mass first and to then calculate the distance between the centers of mass.  The PLUMED input that you would use
for such a calculation reflects this way of thinking.  An example of a PLUMED input that can be used to perform this sort of calculation is shown below: 

\verbatim

# geometric center of mass of first residue
first: CENTER ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
# geometric center of last residue
last: CENTER ATOMS=427-436

d1: DISTANCE ATOMS=first,last
d2: DISTANCE ATOMS=first,last NOPBC

PRINT ARG=d1,d2 STRIDE=1 FILE=COLVAR 

ENDPLUMED
\endverbatim

Make a PLUMED input containing the above input and execute it on the trajectory `traj-broken.xtc` by making use of the following command:

\verbatim
plumed driver --mf_xtc traj-broken.xtc --plumed plumed.dat
\endverbatim

Before we turn to analyzing what is output from this calculation there are a few things to note about this input file.  Firstly, I should describe what this file
instructs PLUMED to do. It tells PLUMED to:

1. calculate the position of the Virtual Atom 'first' as the \ref CENTER of atoms from 1 to 8;
2. calculate the position of the Virtual Atom 'last' as the \ref CENTER of atoms from 427 to 436;
3. calculate the distance between the two atoms 'first' and 'last' and saves it in 'd1';
4. calculate the distance (ignoring periodic boundary conditions) between the two atoms 'first' and 'last' and saves it in 'd2';
5. print the content of 'd1' and 'd2' in the file COLVAR for every frame of the trajectory

Notice that in the input above we have used two different ways of writing the atoms used in the \ref CENTER calculation:

1. ATOMS=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 is the explicit list of the atoms we need
2. ATOMS=427-436 is the range of atoms needed

Notice also that ranges of atoms can be defined with a stride which can also be negative as shown by the commands below, which are both equivalent:

3. ATOMS=from,to:by (i.e.: 427-436:2)
4. ATOMS=to,from:-by (i.e.: 436-427:-2)

Lets now return to the business of analyzing what was output by the calculation.  Lets begin by looking at the contents of the COLVAR file that was output.
When you do so you should find that the first few lines of this file read:

ANALIZE OUTPUT -> repeat with traj-whole.xtc. Comment about differences.

Finally, let's repeat Exercise 2 and use the \ref GROUP virtual atom to specify the list of CA atoms. Pretty convenient, right?
