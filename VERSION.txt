# Should be in the form
# major.minor+whatever
# Typically, 2.X.Y where Y is the patch number
# On git repo, we can use 2.X.Y-dev, then remove the "dev" upon release
# (this is same as gromacs)
# Notice that "plumed info --version" will return only 2.X
# and "plumed info --long-version" will return the full string
