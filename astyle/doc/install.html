    <h3 id="_Artistic_Style_Versions">Artistic Style Versions</h3>

    <p>
        astyle_x.x_linux.tar.gz is the <strong>Linux </strong>version of Artistic Style. It contains the source code,
        documentation, and makefiles. The Linux Version compile instructions below give information for compiling the
        source code.</p>
    <p>
        astyle_x.x_macos.tar.gz is the <strong>Mac OS </strong>version of Artistic Style. It contains the source code,
        documentation, Xcode project files, and a makefile. The Mac OS Version compile instructions below give information
        for compiling the source code.</p>
    <p>
        astyle_x.x_windows.zip is the <strong>Windows </strong>version of Artistic Style. It contains the source code,
        documentation, Visual C project files, and an executable. The Windows Version compile instructions below give
        information for compiling the source code.</p>
    <p>
        astyle_x.x_windows_xp.zip is the <strong>Windows XP </strong>version of Artistic Style. It is identical to the
        above Windows version except the executable is compiled to be compatible with Windows XP. If you are not running
        Windows XP, use the above version.</p>
    <p>
        Only one platform is supported in each distribution package. If you use Artistic Style on more than one platform
        you will need to download packages for each platform. The main difference in platforms is the build directories
        and the line endings. Most compilers and development packages will accept any type of line ending. The source
        code and documentation are the same for all distributions.</p>

    <h3 id="_Linux_Version">Linux Version </h3>

    <h4 id="_CMake_Linux">CMake Linux</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style has CMake support for GCC, Clang, and Intel compilers. Other compilers will probably work if 
        the necessary options are set. Refer to the section on <a href="#_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</a> for 
        more information.</p>
    <p>
        Since the different builds use the same source files an &quot;out of source&quot; build should be used. The
        default build is a release version. A debug version must be specifically requested. The
        the following options are available for building the various configurations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The default builds the Artistic Style command line executable (astyle). </li>
        <li>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS builds the Artistic Style program as a shared object (libastyle.so). </li>
        <li>BUILD_JAVA_LIBS builds the Artistic Style program as a shared object (libastylej.so) that can be called 
            from a Java program. The Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed for the project to compile.</li>
        <li>BUILD_STATIC_LIBS builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (libastyle.a) that can be 
            statically linked to a user program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>EXAMPLES</h5>

    <p>
        The following examples are assumed to be run from the astyle directory that contains 
        CMakeLists.txt. They show out of source builds that generate makefiles.</p>
    <p>
        To build the console release version:</p>
    <pre>mkdir  as-gcc-exe
cd  as-gcc-exe
cmake  ../
make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the shared debug version:</p>
    <pre>mkdir  --parents  as-gcc-so
cd  as-gcc-so
cmake  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  ../
make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the Java release version using the Clang compiler:</p>
    <pre>mkdir  as-clang-java
cd  as-clang-java
CXX=clang++  CC=clang  cmake  -DBUILD_JAVA_LIBS=1  ../
make
</pre>

    <h5>INSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        The makefile install option installs the astyle executable and documentation files. The default is /usr/bin for
        the executable and /usr/share/doc/astyle for the documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use
        install. </p>

    <p>
        There is no uninstall. The easiest way to uninstall is to use the install_manifest.txt file, for example 
        &quot;<strong>xargs rm &lt; install_manifest.txt</strong>&quot;.</p>

    <h4 id="_GCC_Makefile">GCC Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        To compile using the GCC compiler you must have GCC (3.1 or better) installed.</p>
    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the Artistic Style configurations, use the makefile located in
        the astyle/build/gcc directory. The executables will be in the astyle/build/gcc/bin directory. To build the 
        command line configuration, enter the following:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/gcc<br />make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the other astyle configurations, you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. Entering "make astyle"
        or "make release" will build the command line configuration. Following are the symbolic names and file names (in
        parens) of the various configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>release</strong> or <strong>astyle</strong> builds the Artistic Style command line program. This is the
            default option. </li>
        <li><strong>shared</strong> or <strong>libastyle.so</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared 
            library. </li>
        <li><strong>static</strong> or <strong>libastyle.a</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a static 
            library. </li>
        <li><strong>debug</strong> or <strong>astyled</strong> builds the Artistic Style command line program with debugging
            information </li>
        <li><strong>shareddebug</strong> or <strong>libastyled.so</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library
            with debugging information. </li>
        <li><strong>staticdebug</strong> or <strong>libastyled.a</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a static library
            with debugging information. </li>
        <li><strong>all</strong> builds all the above configurations.
            <p>
                The following Java shared library builds are separate from the above. They include a Java Native Interface (JNI)
                and require that the Java Development Kit (JDK) be installed. The environment variable JAVA_HOME should be defined.
                It defines the install directory for the JDK. The makefile also has default install directories for Java 5 and
                6. If the compile cannot find the file jni.h, either set the variable or change the value in the 
                makefile.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>java </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library which includes the JNI (libastylej.so).
        </li>
        <li><strong>javadebug </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a shared library which includes the JNI and debugging
            information
            (libastylejd.so).</li>
        <li><strong>javaall </strong>builds all the above java configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all the release configurations
        enter:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/gcc<br />make release shared static</pre>
    <p>
        The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</a> section contains additional target 
        options.</p>

    <h4 id="_Clang_Makefile">Clang Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        Clang has a static analyzer that finds potential bugs in C/C++ and Objective-C programs. It can be run as a standalone
        tool from the command-line and runs in tandem with a build. There is a script file, analyze.sh, that will run
        the analysis on Artistic Style.</p>
    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the
        astyle/build/clang directory. The executables will be in the astyle/build/clang/bin directory. To build the command
        line configuration, enter the following:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/clang<br />make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the other astyle configurations, you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. The configurations for
        Clang are the same as for the <a href="#_GCC_Makefile">GCC Makefile</a>. More than one configuration can be
        built at the same time. For example, to build all the release configurations enter:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/clang<br />make release shared static
</pre>
    <p>
        The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</a> section contains additional target 
        options.</p>

    <h4 id="_Intel_Makefile">Intel Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        These procedures and the makefile are for recent versions of the compiler. They may not work for earlier versions.
        Instructions for your compiler are in the compiler documentation file "get_started_lc.htm".</p>
    <p>
        To compile with Intel there are environment variables that must be set by running the compiler environment 
        script compilervars.sh (or compilervars.csh) with an argument that specifies the target architecture. This
        should be done before running the make. If it is not done, &quot;make&quot; will display an error message
        stating that the compiler environment variables are not set.</p>
    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the
        astyle/build/intel directory. The output executables will be in the astyle/build/intel/bin directory. To build
        the command line configuration, enter the following:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/intel<br />make</pre>
    <p>
        To build the other astyle configurations, you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. The configuration names
        for Intel are the same as for the <a href="#_GCC_Makefile">GCC Makefile</a>. More than one configuration can be
        built at the same time. For example, to build the entire debug configurations enter:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/intel<br />make debug shareddebug staticdebug</pre>
    <p>
        The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</a> section contains additional target 
        options.</p>

    <h4 id="_CodeBlocks_Linux">CodeBlocks Linux</h4>

    <p>
        There are build folders for the following compilers. All compiler folders are in the &quot;build&quot; directory.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>cb-clang</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Linux Clang Compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>cb-gcc</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Linux GCC Compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>cb-intel</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Linux Intel Compiler.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are workspace and project files for each folder. All projects have at least Debug and Release 
        configurations. All output will be in the &quot;bin&quot; directory. </p>
    <p>
        The workspace contains the following projects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyle </strong>builds the Artistic Style command line program (astyle). </li>
        <li><strong>AStyle So </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a shared object (libastyle.so). </li>
        <li><strong>AStyle Java </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a shared object (libastylej.so) that can
            be called from a Java program. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is required for the project to compile. The 
            Project Properties must have an include path to the JDK include directories.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyle A </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (libastyle.a). This can be
            statically linked to a user program.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For other Linux development environments, follow the instructions in <a href="#_Other_Development_Environments">Other
            Development Environments</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="_MacOS_Version">MacOS Version</h3>

    <h4 id="_CMake_MacOS">CMake MacOS</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style has CMake support for MacOS. It is used the same as <a href="#_CMake_Linux">CMake Linux</a>
        except the supported compilers are only GCC and Clang.</p>

    <h4 id="_MacOS_Makefile">MacOS Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The Artistic Style makefile compile uses the Mac OS &quot;Command Line Tools&quot;. If you have Xcode 4.3 or newer
        the command line tools, such as &quot;make&quot;, are NOT installed by default. They must be downloaded and installed
        separately. Once everything is successfully installed, you should see &quot;make&quot; and other command line
        developer tools in /usr/bin.</p>
    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the Artistic Style configurations use the makefile located in the
        astyle/build/mac directory. The executables will be in the astyle/build/mac/bin directory. To build the command
        line configuration, enter the following:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/mac<br />make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the other astyle configurations, you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. The configurations for
        Mac are the same as for the <a href="#_GCC_Makefile">GCC Makefile</a>. More than one configuration can be
        built at the same time. For example, to build all the release configurations enter:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/mac<br />make release shared static
</pre>
    <p>
        The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</a> section contains additional target 
        options.</p>

    <h4 id="_Xcode">Xcode</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style workspace and project files for the Xcode development environment are available in the &quot;build/xcode&quot;
        directory. A workspace can be used to build a single project or all the projects. The project files have Debug
        and Release configurations. The following projects are available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyle</strong> builds the Artistic Style command line program (astyle). </li>
        <li><strong>AStyleA</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (libastyle.a). This can be statically
            linked with an executable.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleDylib</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Library (libastyle.dylib). It can
            be used with C/C++, Objective C, C#, and Python programs.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleJava</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Library (libastylej.dylib) that can
            be called from a Java program. The Java Development (JDK) is required for the project to compile. The Project
            Properties must have an include path to the JDK include directory. The output dylib can also be called from a
            C++ or C# program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>INSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        Only the astyle executable is installed. The library project installs are sent to UninstalledProjects in
        the Build directory. The following instructions are for the astyle executable and documentation files. The default
        install directory is /usr/bin for the executable and /usr/share/doc/astyle for the documentation. You must have
        the appropriate permissions to use install. If sudo is not used for the install, an error will occur during the
        build.</p>
    <p>
        To install the astyle executable in the default directory:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/xcode
sudo xcodebuild install -project AStyle.xcodeproj
</pre>
    <p>
        A script is used to install the documentation
        from the same directory.</p>
    <pre>sudo bash install.sh
</pre>

    <h5>UNINSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        Uninstalls the executable and documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall.</p>
    <p>
        A script is used to uninstall astyle and the documentation:</p>
    <pre>sudo bash uninstall.sh
</pre>
    <p>
        NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the .astylerc files from the users' home directories. The files must
        be removed individually for each user.</p>

    <h3 id="_Windows_Version">Windows Version</h3>

    <h4 id="_Precompiled_Executable">Precompiled Executable</h4>

    <p>
        In addition to the source files, the Windows distribution package contains an Artistic Style Win32 executable
        (AStyle.exe). If you prefer to compile the executable yourself, pursue the following instructions.</p>

    <h4 id="_CMake_Windows">CMake Windows</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style has CMake support for Borland, and MinGW compilers. Other compilers will probably work if 
        the necessary options are set. Refer to the section on <a href="#_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</a> for 
        more information.</p>
    <p>
        The console executable will run for both of the supported compilers. The DLL builds may not. CMake does not 
        fully support all Windows compilers. To build the DLLs it would be best to generate an IDE project file and 
        compile the DLLs with the IDE. The &quot;build&quot; folder contains project files for CodeBlocks and Visual Studio.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the different builds use the same source files an &quot;out of source&quot; build should be used. The
        default build for MinGW is a release version. A debug version must be specifically requested. For 
        Borland, a release build may need to be specifically requested, depending on the CMake release used. Borland 
        has been tested with the bcc32c free compiler. It may or may not work with other Borland compilers. The the following
        options are available for building the various configurations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The default builds the Artistic Style command line executable (AStyle.exe). </li>
        <li>BUILD_SHARED_LIBS builds the Artistic Style program as a DLL (AStylexx.dll, where xx is the astyle release 
            number). </li>
        <li>BUILD_JAVA_LIBS builds the Artistic Style program as a DLL (AStylexxj.dll, where xx is the astyle release 
            number) that can be called from a Java program. The Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed for the project
            to compile.</li>
        <li>BUILD_STATIC_LIBS builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (AStyleLib.lib) that can be 
            statically linked to a user program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>EXAMPLES</h5>

    <p>
        The following examples are assumed to be run from the astyle directory that contains 
        CMakeLists.txt. They show out of source builds that generate makefiles. </p>
    <p>
        A path to the compiler executable 
        may need to be declared before compiling. And the Borland free compiler will need the compiler name.
        To set the variables before compiling (replace the path names with the paths on your computer):</p>
    <pre>set PATH=C:\Program Files\CMake\bin;%PATH%
set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\BCC101\bin;%PATH%
set CXX=bcc32c
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the Borland console release version (the release build may need to be specified):</p>
    <pre>md  as-bcc32c-exe
cd  as-bcc32c-exe
cmake  -G "Borland Makefiles"  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  ../
make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the MinGW console release version:</p>
    <pre>md  as-mingw-exe
cd  as-mingw-exe
cmake  -G "MinGW Makefiles"  ../
mingw32-make</pre>

    <p>As stated previously, the DLL builds may not work with the CMake generated makefiles.</p>
    <h5>INSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        The makefile install option installs the astyle executable and documentation files. The default is &quot;C:\Program
        Files (x86)\AStyle&quot; for the executable and &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\AStyle\doc&quot; for the documentation.
        You may need to run as an administrator to install. </p>

    <p>
        There is no uninstall. The uninstall must be done manually. Just remove the two folders indicated in the 
        Install. </p>

    <h4 id="_CodeBlocks_Windows">CodeBlocks Windows</h4>

    <p>
        There are build folders for the following compilers. All compiler folders are in the &quot;build&quot; directory.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>cb-bcc32c</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Embarcadero BCC32C Compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>cb-mingw</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the MinGw or TDM_GCC Compilers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are workspace and project files for each folder. All projects have at least Debug and Release configurations.
        All output
        will be in the &quot;bin&quot; directory.</p>
    <p>
        The workspace contains the following projects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyle </strong>builds the Artistic Style command line program (AStyle.exe). </li>

    <h4 id="_Visual_Studio">Visual Studio</h4>

    <p>
        There are solution and project files for several versions of Microsoft Visual Studio. Open an Artistic Style solution
        file in the appropriate &quot;build&quot; directory. All projects have Debug, Release and Static configurations.
        Debug file output will be in the &quot;debug&quot; directory. Release file output will be in the &quot;bin&quot;
        directory. Static file output will be in the "binstatic" directory. The following solution files are 
        available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All AStyle </strong>builds the release and the debug configurations for all the following.
        </li>
        <li><strong>AStyle </strong>builds the Artistic Style command line program (AStyle.exe). This project has an extra
            &quot;Static&quot;" option. It is the same as the &quot;Release&quot; build except that it is linked with a static
            runtime library. This is needed if the executable is to be run on a system without Visual Studio installed. The
            builds for this configuration are placed in a separate &quot;binstatic&quot; directory. </li>
        <li><strong>AStyle Dll </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link Library (AStyle.dll). This will
            also build an export library and a static library for linking the dll. </li>
        <li><strong>AStyle Java </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a Dynamic Link Library (AStylej.dll) that can
            be called from a Java program. The Java Development (JDK) is required for the project to compile. The Project
            Properties must have an include path to the JDK include and include/win32 directories. This is set in &quot;Project
            &gt; Properties &gt; C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Additional&nbsp;Include&nbsp;Directories&quot;. The default setting
            is for the JDK to be installed in the default directory, but it may not be the most current release. The output
            DLL can also be called from a C++ or C# program.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyle Lib </strong>builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (libAStyle.lib). This can be
            statically linked to a calling program.</li>

    <h3 id="_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</h3>

    <p>
        The following makefile targets are available for GCC, Clang, Intel, and Mac.</p>

    <h5>CLEAN</h5>

    <p>
        Removes the object and executable files for all configurations.</p>
    <p>
        To remove the files for all configurations:</p>
    <pre>make clean
</pre>

    <h5>CLEANOBJ</h5>

    <p>
        Removes the object files for all configurations. The executables will not be removed.</p>
    <p>
        To remove only the object files for all configurations:</p>
    <pre>make cleanobj
</pre>

    <h5>INSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        Installs the astyle executable and documentation files. The default is /usr/bin for the executable and /usr/share/doc/astyle
        for the documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.</p>
    <p>
        To install the astyle to the default directories:</p>
    <pre>sudo make install
</pre>
    <p>
        To install astyle to a different bin directory set a value for the macro $(prefix). For example, to install the
        executable to a user's home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
    <pre>sudo make prefix=$HOME install
</pre>

    <h5>UNINSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        Uninstalls the executable and documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall.</p>
    <p>
        To uninstall astyle from the default directories:</p>
    <pre>sudo make uninstall
</pre>
    <p>
        To uninstall the files from a different directory set a value for the macro $(prefix). For example, to uninstall
        the files from a user's home directory (/home/<i>user</i>):</p>
    <pre> sudo make prefix=$HOME uninstall
</pre>
    <p>
        NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the .astylerc files from the users' home directories. The files must
        be removed individually for each user.</p>

    <h3 id="_Other_Development_Environments">Other Development Environments</h3>

    <p>
        To use other development environments project files usually must be built. CMake can be used if the development
        environment is supported. Otherwise, use the development environment to create files.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a project using the development environment.</li>
        <li>Add to the project all the .cpp and .h files in the "src" directory.</li>
        <li>The Compiler Options section discusses the compiler options to use.</li>
        <li>Compile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</h3>

    <p>
        No macro definitions are required to compile the executable. To compile as a static or shared (dynamic) library
        define the macro ASTYLE_LIB. To compile a Java shared (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_JNI. The
        option ASTYLE_NO_EXPORTS is sometimes needed for static libraries to prevent compiler error and warning
        messages. Use the appropriate compiler and linker options to compile the static or shared library. Add debug
        options to compile the debug versions.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style is a small program and it is best to optimize for speed. The debug configurations are not usually
        optimized. To optimize for speed in the release configurations, use the macro NDEBUG to remove asserts. If
        necessary, use an option to activate the C++11 standards (-std=c++11 or -std=c++0x on most compilers). Use an
        option that allows inline function expansion. Runtime Type Information (RTTI) is NOT needed and exceptions are
        NOT used. Use whole program optimization if your compiler supports it. There may be other options you can use
        depending on the compiler. </p>
