GIT VERSION

Several branches and tags are stored on the git repository.

Branches named v2.X correspond to release branches.

Master branch may contain non tested features and is not expected to be used by non-developers.
It is typically containing features that will be available on the next release.

Tags named v2.XbY correspond to beta releases - use with care
Tags named v2.X.Y correspond to official releases - use the latest available.

To report problems found on beta or official releases, use the normal plumed-users
mailing list. Just state exactly which version you are using.

To report problems found on master branch, use the plumed2-git mailing list.
This is also the correct place for discussions about new features etc.
When reporting please provide the git hash (get it with "git rev-parse HEAD").
