Branches and releases
---------------------

Several branches and tags are stored on the git repository.

Branches named `v2.X` correspond to release branches.

Master branch may contain non tested features and is not expected to be used by non-developers.
It typically contains features that will be available on the next release.

Tags named `v2.XbY` correspond to beta releases, use it with care.
Tags named `v2.X.Y` correspond to official releases, use the latest available.

In addition, the repository contains a number of other branches related to specific features.
Please contact the developers that are committing on those branches before basing your work
there, since they might contain temporary work and might be rebased later.
For instance, branch `testdoc` is setup so as to push a test copy of the manual
and is often force pushed.

To report problems found on beta or official releases, use the normal
[plumed-users@googlegroups.com](mailto:plumed-users@googlegroups.com)
mailing list. Please state exactly which version you are using.
To report problems found on `master` branch, use the
[plumed2-git@googlegroups.com](plumed2-git@googlegroups.com) mailing list.
This is also the correct place for discussions about new features etc.
When reporting please provide the git hash (you can obtain it with `git rev-parse HEAD`).

Required software
-----------------

Required software:

* GNU make.
* C/c++ compiler (c++17 support is required as of version 2.10).
* A modern version of the `patch` command line tool.

Suggested software (libraries are checked by `./configure` and enabled if available):

* MPI library to run parallel simulations. It should be the same library used by your MD code.
* Optimized blas and lapack libraries. They are automatically replaced by an internal version if not available.
* [VMD molfile plugins](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins) to read arbitrary file formats. They are automatically replaced by an internal version supporting a few formats if not available.
* [Zlib library](http://zlib.net/) to use compressed data files.
* [Doxygen](http:://www.doxygen.org) to build user manual. Doxygen might need the following packages:
  * Latex to build the pdf user manual.
  * [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) to show class hierarchy in
    developer manual.

Quick compilation instructions
------------------------------

Extensive installation instructions are in the [user documentation](http://www.plumed.org/doc).
Quick instructions:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt
    make
    make doc # optional
    make test # optional

User documentation can be found at `user-doc/html/index.html`.
Developer documentation can be found at `developer-doc/html/index.html`.
[Pre-compiled documentation](http://www.plumed.org/doc) is available online, so this is only required
if you are working with a modified version of the code!

In order to run PLUMED without installing it you should type `source sourceme.sh`. However,
we recommend installing PLUMED. 
To install it in `$HOME/opt` (directory should be set during `./configure`):

    umask 022
    make install
    
Now you will be able to run plumed using e.g.

    plumed help

If you compiled your own documentation, paths to the installed documentation can be found with command `plumed info --user-doc`.

A sample modulefile with environment variable will be placed in
`$HOME/opt/lib/plumed/src/lib/modulefile`. This can be useful if you want to
install multiple PLUMED versions side by side and select them with env modules.
