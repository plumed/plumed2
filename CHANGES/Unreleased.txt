@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

Include all fixes in branch 2.1 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-1 .

Changes from version 2.1 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - Labels of quantities calculates by \ref SPRINT have changed from <i>label</i>.coord_<i>num</i> to <i>label</i>.coord-<i>num</i>
  - \ref METAD with WALKERS_MPI now writes a single hills file, without suffixes
  - removed the ./configure.sh script of v2.0.x, now plumed can only be configured using autotools (./configure)
  - \ref COM, \ref CENTER, and \ref GYRATION now automatically make molecules whole. In case you do not want them to do it, use NOPBC flag,
    which recovers plumed 2.1 behavior
- Added experimental OpenMP support, see \ref Openmp
- Added multiple time step integration for bias potentials, see \ref MTS
- Link cells are now used in all multicolvars that involve \ref SwitchingFunctions.  The link cell cutoff is
  set equal to 2.*\f$d_{\textrm{max}}\f$.  Where \f$d_{\textrm{max}}\f$ is the (user-specified) point at which
  the switching function goes to zero. Users should always set this parameter when using a switching function
  in order to achieve optimal performance.
- New actions
  - \ref DUMPMASSCHARGE to dump a file with mass and charges during MD.
  - \ref EFFECTIVE_ENERGY_DRIFT
  - \ref EXTENDED_LAGRANGIAN
  - \ref DFSCLUSTERING calculate the size of clusters 
  - \ref DUMPMULTICOLVAR print out a multicolvar
  - \ref MFILTER_LESS filter multicolvar by the value of the colvar
  - \ref MFILTER_MORE 
  - \ref MFILTER_BETWEEN
  - \ref GRADIENT can be used to calculate the gradient of a quantity.  Used to drive nucleation
  - \ref CAVITY
  - \ref WRAPAROUND to fix periodic boundary conditions.
- New features for existing actions:
  - Keywords UPDATE_FROM and UPDATE_UNTIL to limit update step in a defined time window.
  - Keyword UNNORMALIZED for \ref HISTOGRAM.
  - Keywords for \ref GROUP (REMOVE, SORT, UNIQUE)
  - \ref DUMPATOMS now supports dumping xtc and trr files (requires xdrfile library).
  - \ref driver can now read xtc and trr files also with xdrfile library.
  - \ref driver accepts a --mc flag to read charges and masses from a file produced during
    molecular dynamics with \ref DUMPMASSCHARGE
  - Possibility to enable or disable \ref RESTART on a per action basis.
- VMEAN and VSUM allow one to calculate the sum of a set of vectors calculated by VectorMultiColvar.  Note these
  can also be used in tandem with \ref AROUND or \ref MFILTER_MORE to calculate the average vector within a particular
  part of the cell or the average vector amonst those that have a magnitude greater than some tolerance
