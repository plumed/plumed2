Version 2.3 (Jun 30, 2016)
----------------------------

Version
2.3 contains several improvements with respect to 2.2. Users currently working with 2.2
should have a look at the section "Changes leading to incompatible behavior" below and
might need tiny adjustments in their input files.

Below you find a list of all the changes with respect to version 2.2.
Notice that version 2.3 includes already all the fixes in branch 2.2 up to 2.2.3 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-2 .

Changes from version 2.2 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - \ref COMMITTOR can now be used to define multiple basins, but the syntax has been changed
  - Syntax for \ref SPRINT and \ref DFSCLUSTERING has changed.
    We have separated the Actions that calculate the contact matrix from these actions.  These actions thus now take a contact
    matrix as input.  This means that we these actions can be used with contact matrices that measures whether or not a pair of atoms
    are hydrogen bonded.  For more details on this see \ref contactmatrix.  For clustering the output can now be passed to the actions
    \ref CLUSTER_PROPERTIES, \ref CLUSTER_DIAMETER, \ref CLUSTER_NATOMS, \ref OUTPUT_CLUSTER and \ref CLUSTER_DISTRIBUTION.  These
    provide various different kinds of information about the connected components found by clustering 
  - In \ref driver masses and charges are set by default to NaN.
    This makes it less likely to do mistakes trying to compute centers of mass or electrostatic-dependent variables
    when masses or charges were not set. To compute these variables from the driver you are now forced to use
    `--pdb` or `--mc`.
  - In rational switching functions, by default MM is twice NN. This is valid both in \ref switchingfunction with expanded
    syntax and when specifying MM on e.g. \ref COORDINATION
  - Patch script `plumed patch` now patches by default with `--shared`. This should make the procedure more robust (see \issue{186}).
  - Faster \ref GYRATION but new default behavior is not mass weighted
  - When using \ref HISTOGRAM you now output the accumulated grid using \ref DUMPGRID or \ref DUMPCUBE to get the free energy you use
    the method \ref CONVERT_TO_FES.  These changes allow one to use grids calculated within PLUMED in a work flow of tasks similarly to 
    the way that you can currently use Values.
  - The way that reweighting is performed is now different.  There are three separate actions \ref REWEIGHT_BIAS, \ref REWEIGHT_TEMP and
    \ref REWEIGHT_METAD.  These actions calculate the quantities that were calculated using the keywords REWEIGHT_BIAS and REWEIGHT_TEMP that
    used to appear in the old HISTOGRAM method.  Now those these methods can be used in any methods that calculate ensemble averages for
    example \ref HISTOGRAM and \ref AVERAGE
  - Manual is now build with locally compiled plumed
  - Removed CH3SHIFT
  - \ref CS2BACKBONE is now native in PLUMED removing the need to link ALMOST, small syntax differences
  - \ref CS2BACKBONE, \ref NOE, \ref RDC, removed the keyword ENSEMBLE: now ensemble averages can only be calculated using \ref ENSEMBLE
  - \ref RDC, syntax changes
  - It is not possible anymore to select modules using `modulename.on` and `modulename.off` files. Use `./configure --enable-modules` instead.
- New actions:
  - \ref FIXEDATOM
  - \ref HBOND_MATRIX
  - \ref CLUSTER_PROPERTIES
  - \ref CLUSTER_DIAMETER
  - \ref CLUSTER_NATOMS
  - \ref OUTPUT_CLUSTER
  - \ref CLUSTER_DISTRIBUTION
  - \ref ROWSUMS
  - \ref COLUMNSUMS
  - \ref UPDATE_IF
  - \ref DUMPGRID
  - \ref DUMPCUBE
  - \ref CONVERT_TO_FES
  - \ref INTERPOLATE_GRID
  - \ref FIND_CONTOUR
  - \ref FIND_SPHERICAL_CONTOUR
  - \ref FIND_CONTOUR_SURFACE
  - \ref AVERAGE
  - \ref REWEIGHT_BIAS
  - \ref REWEIGHT_TEMP
  - \ref REWEIGHT_METAD
  - \ref PCA
  - \ref PRE
  - \ref STATS
  - \ref METAINFERENCE
  - \ref LOCALENSEMBLE
  - \ref FRET
  - \ref RESET_CELL
- New features in MD patches (require repatch):
  - Patch for amber 14 now passes charges with appropriate units (fixes \issue{165}). Notice that
    the patch is still backward compatible with older PLUMED version, but the charges will only be passed
    when using PLUMED 2.3 or later.
  - Patch for GROMACS 5.1 incorporates Hamiltonian replica exchange, see \ref hrex
  - Gromacs 2016, 5.1.x, 5.0.x, flush the plumed output files upon checkpointing
  - Added patch for Gromacs 2016
  - Removed the patch for Gromacs 4.6.x 
- New features for existing actions:
  - The SPECIES and SPECIESA keyword in MultiColvars can now take a multicolvar as input.  This allows one
    to calculate quantities such as the Q4 parameters for those atoms that have a coordination number greater
    than x.
  - Added MATHEVAL type in \ref switchingfunction
  - Added Q type native contacts in \ref switchingfunction (thanks to Jan Domanski).
  - \ref COMMITTOR can now be used to define multiple basins
  - The number of atoms admitted in \ref BRIDGE has been significantly increased, see \issue{185}.
  - \ref driver now allows --trajectory-stride to be set to zero when reading with --ixtc/--itrr. In this case, step number is read from the trajectory file.
  - \ref METAD and \ref PBMETAD can now be restarted from a GRID 
  - Added keywords TARGET and DAMPFACTOR in \ref METAD
  - \ref ENSEMBLE added keywords for weighted averages, and calculation of higher momenta
  - \ref MOLINFO now allows single atoms to be picked by name.
  - \ref FIT_TO_TEMPLATE now supports optimal alignment.
  - \ref CONSTANT added the possibility of storing more values as components with or without derivatives
- Other features:
  - Added a plumed-config command line tool. Can be used to inspect configuration also when cross compiling.
  - Added a `--mpi` option to `plumed`, symmetric to `--no-mpi`. Currently, it has no effect (MPI is initialized by default when available).
  - PLUMED now generate a VIM syntax file, see \ref VimSyntax
  - The backward cycle is now parallelised in MPI/OpenMP in case many collective variables are used.
  - More and more documentation

For developers:
- IMPORTANT: BIAS can now be BIASED as well, this changes can lead to some incompatibility: now the "bias" component is always defined automatically
  by the constructure as a componentWithDerivatives, derivatives are automaticcaly obtained by forces. The main change is that you don't have to define
  the bias component anymore in your constructor and that you can use setBias(value) to set the value of the bias component in calculate. 
- Added new strings for plumed cmd: setMDMassUnits, setMDChargeUnits, readInputLine, performCalcNoUpdate, update and doCheckPoint.
- Easier to add actions with multiple arguments
- New functions to access local quantities in domain decomposition

Fixes in beta
-------------

Fixes since 2.3b. Relevant things could be merged in the changelog above when we release 2.3.0

- Fixed critical pragma in openmp of Colvar. This could have lead to wrong virial accumulation.
- Extended checkpoint infrastracture, now \ref METAD and \ref PBMETAD will write GRIDS also on checkpoint step (only the GROMACS patch
  is currently using the checkpointing interface)
- Fixed a bug in \ref PBMETAD that was preventing the writing of GRIDS if a hill was not added in that same step 
- GSL library is now searched by default during `./configure`.
- Removed IMD modules. In case someone is interested in restoring it, please contact the PLUMED developers.
- (for developers) Active modules to enable regtests are chosen using `plumed config`.
- New CV: \ref JCOUPLING
- New CV: \ref ERMSD
- \ref PUCKERING now supports 6 membered rings.
- Tutorials have been (partially) updated to reflect some of the changes in the syntax
- gromacs 5.1.x patch updated to 5.1.4
- gromacs 2016.x patch updated to 2016.1
- LAMMPS patch updated to support multiple walkers and report plumed bias to LAMMPS (thanks to Pablo Piaggi).
- When using \ref METAD with file-based multple walkers and parallel jobs (i.e. mpirun) extra suffix is not added (thanks to Marco De La Pierre).
- Parser now reports errors when passing numbers that cannot be parsed instead of silently replacing their default value. See \issue{104}.
- (for developers) A script is available to check if source code complies plumed standard. Notice that this script is run together with cppcheck on travis-ci.
- (for developers) Cppcheck on travis-ci has been updated to 1.75. Several small issues triggering errors on 1.75 were fixed (e.g. structures passed by value
   are now passed by const ref) and false positives marked as such.
- (for developers) Added coverage scan.
