@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.5

Changes from version 2.4 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
- New actions:
  - \ref PAMM
  - \ref HBPAMM_MATRIX
  - \ref HBPAMM_SH
- Libmatheval is not used anymore. \ref MATHEVAL (and \ref CUSTOM) are still available
  but employ an internal implementation of the lepton library. There should be no observable difference
  except from the fact that lepton does not support some of the inverse and hyperbolic functions supported
  by matheval (easily writable as a function of the available ones).

Changes from version 2.4 which are relevant for developers:
- Code has been cleanup up replacing a number of pointers with `std::unique_ptr`.
  (WORK IN PROGRESS: in principle we could aim at eliminating all delete statements)
