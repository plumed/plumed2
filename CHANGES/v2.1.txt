@page CHANGES-2-1 CHANGES-2-1

Includes all fixes in branch 2.0 (see \ref CHANGES-2-0) up to 2.0.1

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for users:
- Several optimizations in the following actions: WHOLEMOLECULES, ...
- Faster atom scattering with domain decomposition.

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for developers:
- Added regtests for plumed as a library (e.g. basic/rt-make-0). plumed command has an additional
  flag (--is-installed) to probe if running from a compilation directory or from a fully installed copy
  (this is needed for regtests to work properly).
- Improved class Communicator. Many operations can now be done directly on Vectors, Tensors, and std::vector.
- Patches for GPL codes (QuantumEspresso and Gromacs) now also include
  original code so as to simplify their modification.
