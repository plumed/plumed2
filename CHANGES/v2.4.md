## Version 2.4 (Dec 15, 2017)

Version 2.4 contains several improvements with respect to 2.3. Users currently working with 2.3
should have a look at the section "Changes leading to incompatible behavior" below and
might need tiny adjustments in their input files.
Notice that version 2.4 includes already all the fixes in branch 2.3 up to 2.3.3 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-3 .

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - A c++11 compliant compiler is required (see \issue{212}). This should mean:
    - gcc 4.8
    - clang 3.3
    - intel 15
    Since the number of c++11 features that we use is limited, older compilers might work as well.
  - The meaning of BIASFACTOR=1 in \ref METAD has been modified and can now be used to indicate unbiased
    simulations. Non-well-tempered metadynamics is BIASFACTOR=-1, which is the new default value.
    Notice that this has an implication on the biasfactor written in the HILLS file when doing
    non-well-tempered metadynamics.
  - Due to a change in \ref COMMITTOR, the format of its output file has been slightly changed.
  - \ref HISTOGRAM : When using weights default is now to output histogram divided by number of frames from which data was taken.  In addition the 
    UNORMALIZED flag has been replaced with the keyword NORMALIZATION, which can be set equal to true, false or ndata.
  - All switching functions are now stretched by default, also when using the "simple syntax" (e.g. `COORDINATION NN=6`).
    Switching functions were already stretched by default when using the advanced syntax (e.g. `COORDINATION SWITCH={}`)
    since version 2.2.  Notice that this will introduce small numerical differences in the computed switching functions.
- New modules:
  - A new PLUMED-ISDB module have been included, this module includes a number of CVs to calculate experimental data with the internal ability
    to also calculate a \ref METAINFERENCE score.

- New command line tools:
  - \ref pesmd : Tool for performing Langevin dynamics on an energy landscape that is specified using a PLUMED input file
  - \ref pathtools 
- Other changes:
  - Sharing coordinates and applying force is now faster (in some cases these can result in much better scaling of the performances in parallel).
  - \ref COMMITTOR : new flag to use committor to keep track of the visited basins without stopping the simulation
  - \ref PBMETAD : multiple walkers using files (thanks to Marco De La Pierre).
  - \ref PBMETAD : adaptive gaussians
  - \ref PBMETAD : default names for GRID and FILE (usefull with many collective variables) 
  - \ref METAD : BIASFACTOR=1 is allowed and performs unbiased sampling. HILLS file can be used
    to recover free energy also in this case.
  - \ref METAD : a RECT option is available that allows setting an array of bias factors, one for each replica.
  - \ref METAD : added options to perform Transition Tempered Metadynamics (thanks to James Dama)
  - \ref PATHMSD and \ref PROPERTYMAP now support alignment to a close structure (thanks to Jana Pazurikova)
  - PDB files with more than 100k atoms can now be read using [hybrid 36](http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36/) format,
    see \issue{226}.
  - Added lepton support. Set env var `export PLUMED_USE_LEPTON=yes` to activate lepton as a matheval replacement
    in \ref MATHEVAL, \ref CUSTOM, and \ref switchingfunction "MATHEVAL switching function".
    Notice that in v2.5 matheval support will be dropped and all these keywords will use lepton.
    See \issue{244}.
  - When parsing constants, PLUMED uses lepton library. This allows to pass
    arguments such as `HEIGHT=exp(0.5)` (see \ref parsing-constants).
  - \ref CUSTOM function has been added as an alias to \ref MATHEVAL .
  - Trajectories read in \ref driver also support the usual replica convention, that is if
    trajectory with replica suffix is not found the driver will look for a trajectory without the replica suffix.
  - A new syntax (`@replicas:`) can be used to specify different arguments for different replicas (see \ref special-replica-syntax).
  - Internal molfile implementation has been updated to VMD 1.9.3.
  - Examples in the documentation now have syntax highlighting and links to the documentation of used actions.
  - \ref COORDINATIONNUMBER : Added option to have pairwise distance moments of coordination number in the multicolvar module
  - GROMACS patch updated to gromacs-2016.4
  - Implemented HREX for gromacs-2016.4.
  - Added patch for Quantum ESPRESSO 6.2 (thanks to Ralf Meyer).
  - Fixed a bug in \ref LOCAL_AVERAGE which appears when you use SPECIESA and SPECIESB keywords instead of just SPECIES
  - Added possibility to pass `--kt` from \ref driver.

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for developers:
  - A few fixes has been made to improve exception safety. Although we still cannot declare
    PLUMED totally exception safe (there are still many non-safe pointers around),
    this made it possible to add a regtest that actually tests erroneous cmd strings
    and erroneous inputs.
  - Due to the required c++11 support, travis-ci test on Ubuntu Precise has been removed.
  - `gettimeofdate` and `gettime` have been replaced with portable `chrono` classes introduced in c++11.
  - C++ exceptions are enabled by default.
  - A large number of loops have been changed to use the `auto` keyword in order to improve code readability.
  - Stack trace is not written upon error anymore, unless environment variable `PLUMED_STACK_TRACE` is set at runtime.
  - Fixed a potential bug using single precision system blas on a mac (notice that currently plumed only uses
    double precision, so it is harmless).
  - Added `--enable-rpath` option for autoconf (off by default).
  - Files related to changelog are now stored as `.md` files. This makes
    it possible to navigate them from github.
  - `configure.ac` has been simplified and improved in order to more easily probe C++ libraries.
  - added `plumed_custom_skip` function to regtests in order to skip specific tests based on specific conditions (e.g. OS).
  - environment variable `LDSO` has been renamed to `LDSHARED`, which is standard in the python community.
  - a `libplumedWrapper.a` library is installed as well, that is used in `--runtime` patching.
  - pkgconfig files are installed.
  - `plumed config makefile_conf` can be used to retrieve `Makefile.conf` file a posteriori.
  - Store `MPIEXEC` variable at configure time and use it later for running regtests. Notice that in case
    `MPIEXEC` is not specified regtests will be run using the command stored in env var `PLUMED_MPIRUN` or, if this is
    also not defined, using `mpirun`.
  - Added canonical makefile targets `check` and `installcheck`. Notice that `check` runs checks with
    non-installed plumed whereas `installcheck` uses the installed one, including its correct program name if it
    was personalized (e.g. with suffixes). Notice that this modifies the previously available `check` target.
