@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.4

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - A c++11 compliant compiler is required (see \issue{212}). This should mean:
    - gcc 4.8
    - clang 3.3
    - intel 15
    Since the number of c++11 features that we use is limited, older compilers might work as well.
- The meaning of BIASFACTOR=1 in \ref METAD has been modified and can now be used to indicate unbiased
  simulations. Non-well-tempered metadynamics is BIASFACTOR=-1, which is the new default value.
  Notice that this has an implication on the biasfactor written in the HILLS file when doing
  non-well-tempered metadynamics.
- Due to a change in \ref COMMITTOR, the format of its output file has been slightly changed.
- \ref HISTOGRAM : When using weights default is now to output histogram divided by number of frames from which data was taken.  In addition the 
  UNORMALIZED flag has been replaced with the keyword NORMALIZATION, which can be set equal to true, false or ndata.
- New modules:
  - A new EDS module have been included, contributed by Glen Hocky and Andrew White.
    This module implements the following methods:
    - \ref EDS
- New collective variables:
  - \ref DIMER (thanks to Marco Nava).
  - \ref IMPLICIT : EEF1-SB implicit solvent solvation energy
  - \ref ADAPTIVE_PATH : Adaptive path variables using the method from \cite BerndAdaptivePath
- New actions:
  - \ref INENVELOPE
- Other changes:
  - \ref COMMITTOR : new flag to use committor to keep track of the visited basins without stopping the simulation
  - \ref PBMETAD : multiple walkers using files (thanks to Marco De La Pierre).
  - \ref PBMETAD : adaptive gaussians
  - \ref PBMETAD : default names for GRID and FILE (usefull with many collective variables) 
  - \ref METAD : BIASFACTOR=1 is allowed and performs unbiased sampling. HILLS file can be used
    to recover free energy also in this case.
  - \ref METAD : added options to perform Transition Tempered Metadynamics (thanks to James Dama)
  - PDB files with more than 100k atoms can now be read using [hybrid 36](http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36/) format,
    see \issue{226}.
  - Trajectories read in \ref driver also support the usual replica convention, that is if
    trajectory with replica suffix is not found the driver will look for a trajectory without the replica suffix.
  - Internal molfile implementation has been updated to VMD 1.9.3.
  - Examples in the documentation now have syntax highlighting and links to the documentation of used actions.
  - \ref COORDINATIONNUMBER : Added option to have pairwise distance moments of coordination number in the multicolvar module
  - \ref pesmd : Tool for performing Langevin dynamics on an energy landscape that is specified using a PLUMED input file

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for developers:
  - A few fixes has been made to improve exception safety. Although we still cannot declare
    PLUMED totally exception safe (there are still many non-safe pointers around),
    this made it possible to add a regtest that actually tests erroneous cmd strings
    and erroneous inputs.
  - Due to the required c++11 support, travis-ci test on Ubuntu Precise has been removed.
  - `gettimeofdate` and `gettime` have been replaced with portable `chrono` classes introduced in c++11.
  - C++ exceptions are enabled by default.
  - Stack trace is not written upon error anymore, unless environment variable `PLUMED_STACK_TRACE` is set at runtime.
